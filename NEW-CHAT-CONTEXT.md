# RightFit Interior Designer - Development Context (ARCHIVED - SEE NEW-CHAT-CONTEXT-UPDATED.md)

## 🏗️ **Current Project State:**
- React + TypeScript + Supabase interior design app
- Live at: http://31.97.115.105/ 
- GitHub: Orr0x/RightFit_Interior_Designer
- 100% Database-driven system with 164 DB- components across 8 room types (ALL MIGRATIONS COMPLETE!)
- Multi-room project system with 2D/3D visualization

## 🚨 **GOLDEN RULES (NEVER BREAK):**
1. **DON'T TOUCH CORNER UNIT GEOMETRY** - Sacred and untouchable
2. **Use proper Git branching** - feature branches first, then merge to main
3. **User prefers PowerShell commands** when terminal gets stuck
4. **User can't use Supabase CLI** - paste SQL directly into database
5. **Make plans before implementing** - user likes detailed approaches
6. **Be creative and detailed** - aim to amaze the user

## 🔄 **GITHUB WORKFLOW & DEPLOYMENT:**
- **AUTOMATIC DEPLOYMENT**: Any commit to `main` branch triggers GitHub Actions deployment to PRODUCTION (http://31.97.115.105/)
- **NEVER commit directly to main** - always use feature branches for development
- **Branch naming convention**: Use descriptive names specific to the task
- **Merge process**: Feature branch → Pull Request → Review → Merge to main → Auto-deploy

### **📋 TODAY'S RECOMMENDED BRANCHES:**
- `feature/3d-model-database-migration` - For migrating 3D models to database
- `feature/3d-positioning-controls` - For enhanced 3D positioning in properties panel  
- `cleanup/remove-hardcoded-components` - For cleaning up unused hardcoded 2D components
- `enhancement/kitchen-3d-improvements` - For improving kitchen 3D component details

## 🎯 **Recent Major Completions:**
- ✅ User tier system (Guest→God) with DevTools access
- ✅ Complete DevTools suite (Git, Blog, Media, Gallery managers)  
- ✅ Database-driven component library migration (2D components)
- ✅ Enhanced drag & drop with precision positioning
- ✅ Smart click selection (5px drag threshold)
- ✅ CSS scaling fixes for coordinate conversion

## 🔧 **Key Technical Details:**
- Main components: `CompactComponentSidebar`, `DesignCanvas2D`, `ProjectContext`
- Database: `components` table with `component_room_types` junction
- Drag system: 1.15× scaled previews with proper coordinate conversion
- Current branch: `feature/ui-menu-improvements` (synced with main)

## 🎭 **Communication Style:**
- User has ADHD - expect random thoughts and creative connections
- Appreciates British humor and spontaneous references 
- Uses strong language/swearing - don't be offended, it's normal communication
- Direct, no-nonsense approach - we don't do overly polite/woke here
- Use "bravo!" for good work, expect "dumbass" when you mess up
- Say "Time for bed!" (Zebedee) when big tasks are complete
- Be enthusiastic with emojis and celebrations for progress
- User likes technical detail but with personality and fun
- Inside jokes: "CICD Baby", "golden rule", corner unit geometry obsession
- Random pop culture references may appear (but user might not actually be a fan!)

## 🎯 **TODAY'S MISSION: 3D MODEL DATABASE MIGRATION**

### **CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS:**
- ❌ **3D models are HARDCODED** in `src/components/designer/EnhancedModels3D.tsx` (1,612 lines!)
- ✅ **2D cleanup completed**: Removed `ComponentLibrary.tsx`, `EnhancedSidebar.tsx`, `src/data/components.tsx` (~4,000 lines of dead code eliminated!)
- ✅ **2D components working**: `CompactComponentSidebar.tsx` uses database via `useComponents` hook

### **TODAY'S TASKS:**

#### **🧹 Phase 1: Technical Debt Cleanup**
1. ✅ **Audit remaining hardcoded 2D components** - COMPLETED
   - ✅ Removed `ComponentLibrary.tsx`, `EnhancedSidebar.tsx`, `src/data/components.tsx` 
   - ✅ Deleted obsolete extraction scripts
   - ✅ All 2D components now fully database-driven

#### **🎨 Phase 2: 3D Model Database Migration**
2. **Create 3D model database schema**
   - Design `3d_models` table with model paths, materials, textures
   - Link to existing `components` table
   - Support for different model formats/LOD levels

3. **Extract existing 3D model definitions**
   - Parse `EnhancedModels3D.tsx` for all 3D model logic
   - Create migration script to populate 3D model database
   - Maintain compatibility with existing designs

4. **Implement database-driven 3D system**
   - Create `use3DModels` hook similar to `useComponents`
   - Update `View3D.tsx` to load models from database
   - Ensure all existing 3D functionality preserved

#### **🎛️ Phase 3: Enhanced 3D Controls**
5. **3D positioning properties panel**
   - Add X, Y, Z position controls to properties panel
   - Implement rotation controls (pitch, yaw, roll)
   - Add scale controls for individual components
   - Real-time 3D preview updates

#### **📝 Phase 4: Component Enhancement**
6. **Kitchen 3D component improvements**
   - User has detailed notes on kitchen components needing attention
   - Expand component ranges where needed
   - Improve detail and realism of existing models

### **⚠️ TECHNICAL DEBT REMAINING:**
- ✅ ~~`ComponentLibrary.tsx`~~ - DELETED (1,983 lines eliminated!)
- ✅ ~~`EnhancedSidebar.tsx`~~ - DELETED (1,985 lines eliminated!)  
- ✅ ~~`src/data/components.tsx`~~ - DELETED 
- ❌ `EnhancedModels3D.tsx` - All 3D models hardcoded, needs complete database migration

### **🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- All components (2D + 3D) fully database-driven
- No hardcoded component definitions remaining
- Enhanced 3D positioning controls in properties panel
- Improved kitchen 3D component library
- All existing functionality preserved
- Clean, scalable architecture for future growth

**Ready to tackle this ambitious day of 3D migration and cleanup!** 🚀
