# Room Types Changes Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the changes made to room types in the RightFit Interior Designer application on September 8, 2025.

## Changes Made

### Renamed Room Types
- `flooring` → `dining-room`
- `media-wall` → `living-room`

### New Room Types Added
- `utility` - For utility room designs
- `dining-room` - For dining room designs
- `under-stairs` - For under-stairs storage solutions

## Implementation Details

### Code Changes
1. Updated `RoomType` type definition in `src/pages/Designer.tsx`
2. Updated room configurations in `ROOM_CONFIGS` in `src/pages/Designer.tsx`
3. Updated component room type associations in `src/components/designer/ComponentLibrary.tsx`
4. Added new components specific to the new room types

### Component Additions
- **Utility Room**: Added washing machine, tumble dryer, utility sink, and storage components
- **Dining Room**: Added dining table, dining chairs, and sideboard components
- **Under Stairs**: Added custom storage solutions for under-stairs spaces

### Notes for Developers
- The database schema for room types should automatically adapt to the new values when designs are saved
- Existing designs with old room types (`flooring`, `media-wall`) will be displayed using the new room types
- Components previously assigned to the old room types have been reassigned to their respective new room types

## Future Considerations
- Consider adding more specialized components for the new room types
- Potentially add more detailed 3D models for utility room appliances
- Explore adding specific measurement rules for under-stairs designs
