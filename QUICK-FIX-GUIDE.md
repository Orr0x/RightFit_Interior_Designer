# Quick Fix Guide - Database Alignment Issue

## üö® Problem Summary
The application expects a new multi-room database schema (`projects` and `room_designs` tables) but the database still has the old single-room schema (`designs` table only). This causes all project operations to fail.

## ‚úÖ Immediate Solution (5-10 minutes)

### Step 1: Access Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**

### Step 2: Deploy Migration 1 - Create New Schema
1. Open file: `supabase/migrations/20250908160000_create_multi_room_schema.sql`
2. Copy the entire contents
3. Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
4. Click **Run** 
5. ‚úÖ Verify: Should see "Success. No rows returned" or similar

### Step 3: Deploy Migration 2 - Migrate Existing Data
1. Open file: `supabase/migrations/20250908160001_migrate_existing_designs.sql`
2. Copy the entire contents  
3. Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
4. Click **Run**
5. ‚úÖ Verify: Should see migration summary messages

### Step 4: Test Application
1. Refresh your application in the browser
2. ‚úÖ Verify: No more "Database Setup Required" error messages
3. ‚úÖ Verify: Can create new projects
4. ‚úÖ Verify: Existing designs appear as migrated projects

## üîç Verification Queries

Run these in Supabase SQL Editor to verify success:

```sql
-- Check new tables exist
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name IN ('projects', 'room_designs');

-- Check data was migrated
SELECT COUNT(*) as projects FROM projects;
SELECT COUNT(*) as room_designs FROM room_designs;

-- Check a sample migrated project
SELECT p.name, rd.room_type, rd.name as room_name
FROM projects p 
JOIN room_designs rd ON p.id = rd.project_id 
LIMIT 5;
```

## üö® If Something Goes Wrong

### Migration Fails?
1. Check the error message in Supabase SQL Editor
2. Most common issue: Constraint violations with room types
3. Solution: Update room type constraints first if needed

### Application Still Shows Errors?
1. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Check browser console for JavaScript errors

### Data Missing After Migration?
1. Check if `designs_backup` table exists (created by migration)
2. Run verification queries above
3. Contact support if data appears lost

## üìã What These Migrations Do

### Migration 1 (20250908160000):
- Creates `projects` table for multi-room project containers
- Creates `room_designs` table for individual room designs
- Sets up proper relationships and constraints
- Enables Row Level Security (RLS)

### Migration 2 (20250908160001):
- Backs up existing `designs` table
- Converts each design into a project with one room
- Preserves all design data and elements
- Maintains user ownership and permissions

## üéØ Expected Results

After successful migration:
- ‚úÖ Application loads without database errors
- ‚úÖ Existing designs appear as individual projects
- ‚úÖ Can create new multi-room projects
- ‚úÖ Can add multiple room types to projects
- ‚úÖ All design functionality works normally

**Time Estimate**: 5-10 minutes for migration deployment + 5 minutes for testing = **15 minutes total**
