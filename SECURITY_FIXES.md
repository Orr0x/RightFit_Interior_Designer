# Security Fixes Implementation Summary

This document outlines the security fixes that have been implemented for the RightFit Interior Designer application.

## ‚úÖ Implemented Security Fixes

### 1. Row Level Security (RLS) Policy Updates - **CRITICAL**
- **Issue**: The profiles table allowed any authenticated user to view all profiles, creating a privacy risk
- **Fix**: Updated RLS policies to restrict profile visibility to profile owners only
- **Changes**:
  - Dropped the overly permissive "Users can view all profiles" policy
  - Created "Users can view their own profile" policy with proper user_id filtering
  - Added optional `public_profile` boolean field for users who want to make their profile visible
  - Created "Public profiles are viewable by everyone" policy for opt-in profile sharing

### 2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention - **HIGH**
- **Issue**: Direct `innerHTML` usage in ComponentLibrary.tsx created XSS vulnerabilities
- **Fix**: Replaced `innerHTML` with safe DOM manipulation
- **Changes**:
  - Created `createSafeSVGElement()` function in `/src/lib/security.ts` that uses DOMParser
  - Updated ComponentLibrary to use safe SVG creation instead of `innerHTML`
  - Added SVG validation and fallback to safe default icons

### 3. Secure JSON Parsing - **HIGH**
- **Issue**: Direct `JSON.parse()` on unvalidated drag/drop data could cause injection or crashes
- **Fix**: Added comprehensive input validation for drag/drop component data
- **Changes**:
  - Created `parseComponentData()` function with strict validation
  - Validates all required fields, types, and value ranges
  - Sanitizes and normalizes data before use
  - Provides detailed error messages for debugging

### 4. Input Validation for Design Names - **MEDIUM**
- **Issue**: No validation on design names could allow malicious input
- **Fix**: Added comprehensive design name validation
- **Changes**:
  - Created `validateDesignName()` function with length and character restrictions
  - Applied validation in design save operations and name editing
  - Sanitizes potentially dangerous characters while preserving usability

## üö® Manual Configuration Required

### Leaked Password Protection - **IMPORTANT**
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è REQUIRES MANUAL CONFIGURATION

The Supabase security linter detected that leaked password protection is disabled. This needs to be enabled manually in the Supabase dashboard:

1. **Access Supabase Dashboard**:
   - Go to [https://supabase.com/dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
   - Navigate to your project: `akfdezesupzuvukqiggn`

2. **Enable Leaked Password Protection**:
   - Go to Authentication ‚Üí Settings
   - Find "Password Security" section
   - Enable "Leaked password protection"
   - Consider also enabling "Minimum password strength" requirements

3. **Additional Recommended Settings**:
   - Set minimum password length to 8+ characters
   - Enable password strength requirements
   - Consider adding rate limiting for authentication endpoints

## üìä Security Improvements Summary

| Category | Before | After | Status |
|----------|--------|-------|--------|
| **RLS Policies** | Exposed all profiles | User-specific access only | ‚úÖ Fixed |
| **XSS Prevention** | Vulnerable innerHTML usage | Safe DOM manipulation | ‚úÖ Fixed |
| **Input Validation** | No JSON validation | Comprehensive validation | ‚úÖ Fixed |
| **Design Names** | No sanitization | Validated & sanitized | ‚úÖ Fixed |
| **Password Security** | Weak protection | Needs manual config | ‚ö†Ô∏è Pending |

## üîí Additional Security Recommendations

### For Future Development:
1. **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Consider implementing CSP headers to prevent XSS
2. **Rate Limiting**: Add rate limiting for authentication and API endpoints
3. **Error Boundaries**: Implement error boundaries to prevent information disclosure
4. **Security Logging**: Add logging for security-relevant events
5. **Regular Security Audits**: Schedule periodic security reviews

### Best Practices Now in Place:
- ‚úÖ All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- ‚úÖ Database access is properly restricted with RLS
- ‚úÖ No direct DOM manipulation with user content
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive error handling for security functions
- ‚úÖ Type-safe data validation with detailed error messages

## üõ°Ô∏è Testing the Security Fixes

1. **Profile Privacy**: Test that users can only see their own profiles
2. **XSS Prevention**: Try dragging malicious SVG content - should fallback to safe defaults
3. **Input Validation**: Try creating designs with invalid names - should show proper error messages
4. **JSON Validation**: Test drag/drop with malformed data - should handle gracefully

The application is now significantly more secure with these implemented fixes. The only remaining item requires manual configuration in the Supabase dashboard.
