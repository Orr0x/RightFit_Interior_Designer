## ‚úÖ What's Been Completed (12 Stories)

### Stories 1.1-1.8 (October 26, 2025)
These stories established the foundation:

1. **Story 1.1**: Regenerated TypeScript types from Supabase schema
2. **Story 1.2**: Created NEW UNIFIED CoordinateTransformEngine (eliminates asymmetric calculations)
3. **Story 1.3**: Refactored PositionCalculation to use the engine
4. **Story 1.4**: Integrated engine into EnhancedModels3D (3D rendering)
5. **Story 1.5**: Integrated engine into DesignCanvas2D (plan view)
6. **Story 1.6**: Implemented deep equality state check (prevents unnecessary re-renders)
7. **Story 1.7**: Created ComponentPositionValidator utility (Z position validation)
8. **Story 1.8**: Audited component library Z positions + database migration

### Stories 1.9-1.11 (October 27, 2025 - Morning)
These stories fixed critical rendering bugs:

9. **Story 1.9**: Simplified height property usage (`getZPosition()` single source of truth)
10. **Story 1.10**: Created CornerCabinetDoorMatrix utility (door orientation)
11. **Story 1.11**: Refactored elevation-view-handlers to use door matrix

**Key Achievement:** Fixed 7 critical rendering bugs including:
- Height calculation bypass
- Door count logic (width-based now)
- Drawer rendering issues
- Corner door orientation in left/right views
- Finishing components (cornice/pelmet) showing doors

### Story 1.12 (October 27, 2025 - Afternoon)
Test infrastructure established:

12. **Story 1.12**: Complete test infrastructure
   - **210 total tests** (198 unit + 12 E2E)
   - **89.56% code coverage** for circular pattern files
   - **Vitest 3.0.0** configured (unit tests)
   - **Playwright** configured (E2E tests)
   - **GitHub Actions CI/CD** pipeline (4 parallel jobs)
   - Fixed critical singleton initialization bug in CoordinateTransformEngine

**Files to Review:**
- `src/services/2d-renderers/elevation-view-handlers.ts` (many debug logs added in Story 1.11)
- `src/services/ComponentService.ts`
- `src/components/designer/DesignCanvas2D.tsx`

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] All `console.log` replaced with structured logger
- [ ] Logger supports log levels (debug, info, warn, error)

  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ InteractionHandler.tsx    (mouse/keyboard events)
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ GridOverlay.tsx           (grid lines)
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**

4. ‚ùå **NEVER merge to `main`** - Only user can approve production deployments
5. ‚ùå **Pushing to `main` = INSTANT LIVE DEPLOYMENT TO PRODUCTION**

### Current Branch Status
```bash
git branch                # Should show: feature/component-elevation-fixes

## üîß Key Technical Decisions

### 1. NEW UNIFIED SYSTEM (Story 1.2)
**What:** CoordinateTransformEngine eliminates asymmetric left/right calculations

**Before:**
```typescript
// Left and right walls had different coordinate logic (ASYMMETRIC)
if (view === 'left') {
  xPos = roomY + offsetY; // Different formula
} else if (view === 'right') {
  xPos = roomHeight - roomY + offsetY; // Different formula
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
// All views use same engine (SYMMETRIC)
const engine = getCoordinateEngine(roomDimensions);
const result = engine.planToElevation(element.x, element.y, view);
```

### 2. Z Position Single Source of Truth (Story 1.9)
**What:** `ComponentService.getZPosition()` is authoritative

**Priority Order:**
1. `element.z` (explicit override)
2. Database `default_z_position`
3. Type-based fallback (ComponentPositionValidator)

**Never use hardcoded Z positions in rendering code.**

### 3. Width-Based Door Count (Story 1.9)
**What:** IGNORE database `door_count`, use width-based logic

**Rationale:** Database has incorrect data (2 doors for 60cm cabinets)

**Logic:**
```typescript
const doorCount = width <= 60 ? 1 : 2;  // Industry standard
```

### 4. Door Matrix Principle (Story 1.10)
**What:** "Door faces away from walls"

**Matrix:**
```typescript
front-left  ‚Üí right door (away from left wall)
front-right ‚Üí left door  (away from right wall)
back-left   ‚Üí right door (away from left wall)
back-right  ‚Üí left door  (away from right wall)
```

### 5. Function Coverage Threshold (Story 1.12)
**What:** 45% function coverage threshold (not 70%)

**Rationale:** V8 counts 60+ internal mapper lambdas in ComponentIDMapper

**All public API functions are 100% tested.**

---

## üêõ Known Issues and TODOs

### Database Data Quality Issues
**Problem:** `component_2d_renders` table has incorrect data:
- ‚ùå `drawer_count = 0` for all pan-drawer units (should be 2-4)
- ‚ùå `door_count = 2` for 50cm/60cm cabinets (should be 1)
- ‚ùå `door_count = 2` for drawer units (should be 0)

**Current Solution:** Code ignores database and uses width-based/type-based logic

**Future Work:** Create database migration to fix (deferred to after Epic 1)

### Story 1.15 Challenge
**Problem:** DesignCanvas2D.tsx is 117K+ characters

**Warning:** This refactor is complex. Test thoroughly after each extraction.

**Strategy:**
1. Start with smallest module (GridOverlay)
2. Extract one module at a time
3. Run full test suite after each extraction
4. Keep git commits small and incremental
5. User can test in browser after each module

---

## üéØ Recommended Next Steps

### Option A: Continue with Story 1.13 (Structured Logging)
**Time:** 4 hours
**Complexity:** Low
**Value:** High (removes debug clutter)

**Start here:**
1. Read Story 1.13 card: `docs/stories/1.13-structured-logging.md`
2. Review console.logs in `elevation-view-handlers.ts`
3. Create logger utility: `src/utils/Logger.ts`
4. Replace console.logs incrementally
5. Test in development mode

### Option B: Continue with Story 1.14 (Input Validation)
**Time:** 8 hours
**Complexity:** Medium
**Value:** High (prevents bugs)

**Start here:**
1. Read Story 1.14 card: `docs/stories/1.14-input-validation.md`
2. Review existing validation in ComponentPositionValidator
3. Create InputValidator utility: `src/utils/InputValidator.ts`
4. Add validation to API boundaries
5. Write comprehensive unit tests

### Option C: Skip to Story 1.17 (Archive Documentation)
**Time:** 1 hour
**Complexity:** Low
**Value:** Medium (cleanup)

**Good choice if:** You want to complete Epic 1 quickly (only 1.17 is non-code work)

## üö® Critical Warnings

### 1. Don't Break the Tests
- 210 tests must remain passing
- Run `npm run test:run` before committing
- CI/CD will fail if tests break

### 2. Don't Push to Main
- Auto-deploy is enabled
- User will lose trust if production breaks
- Always work on feature branches

### 3. Don't Remove Debug Logs Until Story 1.13
- Current debug logs are intentional (Story 1.11)
- They help with troubleshooting
- Only remove as part of Story 1.13 structured logging

### 4. Don't Modify CoordinateTransformEngine Without Tests
- It's the core of the NEW UNIFIED SYSTEM
- 34 tests with 98.68% coverage
- Breaking it breaks everything

### 5. Don't Hardcode Z Positions
- Use `ComponentService.getZPosition()`
- Story 1.9 established this pattern
- Hardcoding will cause regressions
