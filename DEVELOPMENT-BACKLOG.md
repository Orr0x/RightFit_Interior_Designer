# 🚀 Development Backlog - RightFit Kitchen Designer

## 📋 Current Priority Issues

### 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY - UI/UX Issues
- [ ] **Corner Component Positioning Bug** - Only works in 2/4 corners (top-left, bottom-right work; top-right, bottom-left broken)
  - Root cause: Corner detection uses 120x120cm instead of 90x90cm L-shaped footprint
  - Affects: Corner tall units, corner wall cabinets, corner base cabinets, corner counter-tops
  - Impact: Users cannot place corner components in all corners
- [x] ✅ **Wall Unit Load Issue** - Component timing/race condition causes loading failures
  - Root cause: Database components not loaded when sidebar renders
  - Impact: Users see "NO WALL UNITS AVAILABLE" error
  - **RESOLVED IN PHASE 4.3** - Performance optimization complete
  - **NOTE**: One harmless console error remains during initial load (see Known Issues)
- [ ] **Maximum Update Depth Exceeded** - Console errors when adding new projects
  - Location: ProjectContext.tsx useEffect dependency issues
  - Impact: Console warnings, potential performance issues
  - **MOVED TO PHASE 4** - Performance optimization issue
- [x] ✅ **"User Not Authorized" Red Popup** - Appears briefly on app load
  - Impact: Looks like an error to users, poor UX
  - Root cause: Authentication check before context fully loads
  - **RESOLVED IN PHASE 4.1** - Loading sequence optimization complete
- [ ] **Slow Account Activation** - New accounts take too long to gain app access
  - Impact: Poor onboarding experience, users may think signup failed
  - Root cause: Email validation → database sync → auth token refresh delay
  - **MOVED TO PHASE 4** - Authentication flow optimization
  - **PRIORITY: END OF PHASE** - Test after other optimizations (may be resolved)
- [x] ✅ **Projects Don't Load on First Login** - Existing projects invisible until browser refresh
  - Impact: Users think their projects are lost, confusion and frustration
  - Root cause: Project data not loaded when dashboard renders
  - **RESOLVED IN PHASE 4.2** - Data loading sequence optimization complete

### 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY - Database Migration Completion
- [x] ✅ **Phase 1: Database Schema Expansion** - COMPLETED
- [x] ✅ **Phase 2: Service Layer & Code Refactoring** - COMPLETED  
- [x] ✅ **Phase 3: Legacy Code Cleanup** - COMPLETED
  - Removed hardcoded components.tsx (558 lines)
  - Removed duplicate ComponentDefinition interfaces
  - Updated CompactComponentSidebar to use DatabaseComponent
  - Restored missing 3D model exports
  - 100% database-driven component system achieved
- [ ] **Phase 4: Performance Optimization** - IN PROGRESS (3/8 Complete)
  - **PROGRESS:**
    1. ✅ Loading sequence optimization ("User Not Authorized" popup) - COMPLETE
    2. ✅ Project data loading (projects not visible on first login) - COMPLETE
    3. ✅ Component loading race conditions (wall units not available) - COMPLETE
    4. 🔄 ProjectContext performance (update depth exceeded errors) - NEXT
    5. Database query optimization and intelligent caching
    6. 3D rendering performance improvements
    7. Bundle optimization and memory management
    8. **FINAL:** Authentication flow optimization (test if still needed)

### ⚠️ KNOWN ISSUES - Non-Critical
- **Initial Component Loading Console Error** - Harmless race condition during app startup
  - Error: "WALL UNITS CATEGORY MISSING FROM FINAL GROUPS!" appears once during initial load
  - Root cause: Component filtering runs before database fetch completes
  - Impact: None - error resolves automatically when components load
  - Status: Documented, not fixing - does not affect functionality
  - User impact: Only visible in developer console, invisible to end users

### 🟢 LOW PRIORITY - Enhancements
- [ ] **Elevation View Improvements** - Corner cabinet door face rendering
- [ ] **Component Model Updates** - Some components still have "DB" prefix
- [ ] **3D View Enhancements** - Better lighting and materials
- [ ] **Mobile Responsiveness** - Touch drag and drop support

### 🛡️ DEVELOPMENT PROCESS - Infrastructure
- [ ] **Cursor AI Safety Rules** - Create persistent AI guidelines in Cursor settings
  - Terminal safety protocols (stop when output not visible)
  - Git operation restrictions (user handles all git commands)
  - Error handling procedures (ask before proceeding when uncertain)
  - Development workflow guidelines (safe branches, backlog updates)
