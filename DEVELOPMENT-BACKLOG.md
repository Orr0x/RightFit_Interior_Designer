# 🚀 Development Backlog - RightFit Kitchen Designer

## 📋 Current Priority Issues

### 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY - UI/UX Issues
- [ ] **Corner Component Positioning Bug** - Only works in 2/4 corners (top-left, bottom-right work; top-right, bottom-left broken)
  - Root cause: Corner detection uses 120x120cm instead of 90x90cm L-shaped footprint
  - Affects: Corner tall units, corner wall cabinets, corner base cabinets, corner counter-tops
  - Impact: Users cannot place corner components in all corners

### 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY - Database Migration Completion
- [x] ✅ **Phase 1: Database Schema Expansion** - COMPLETED
- [x] ✅ **Phase 2: Service Layer & Code Refactoring** - COMPLETED  
- [ ] **Phase 3: Legacy Code Cleanup** - Remove any remaining hardcoded values
- [ ] **Phase 4: Performance Optimization** - Optimize database queries and caching

### 🟢 LOW PRIORITY - Enhancements
- [ ] **Elevation View Improvements** - Corner cabinet door face rendering
- [ ] **Component Model Updates** - Some components still have "DB" prefix
- [ ] **3D View Enhancements** - Better lighting and materials
- [ ] **Mobile Responsiveness** - Touch drag and drop support
