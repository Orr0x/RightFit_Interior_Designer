# üöÄ Development Backlog - RightFit Kitchen Designer

## üìã Current Priority Issues

### üî¥ CRITICAL PRIORITY - Core Architecture Issues

- [ ] **URGENT: Production Deployment Crash Investigation** - Ceiling height implementation crashes production
  - **Issue**: Recent ceiling height control feature causes complete production app crash on load
  - **Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è REVERTED (commit 02d9bea) - Production restored to stable state
  - **Local vs Production**: Feature works perfectly locally, crashes in production environment
  - **Potential Causes**: 
    - Three.js "BatchedMesh" export warning during production build
    - Environment-specific minification/bundling issues
    - Memory constraints or resource allocation differences
    - Unhandled production-specific error conditions
  - **Investigation Required**: 
    - Production error logs and stack traces
    - Build environment comparison (Node.js, npm versions)
    - Three.js version compatibility check
    - Error boundary implementation for graceful fallback
  - **Impact**: CRITICAL - blocks deployment of ceiling height feature
  - **Priority**: URGENT - must resolve before any new feature deployment
  - **Next Steps**: Investigate production logs, test production build locally, identify root cause
- [ ] **2D/3D Room Dimension Inconsistency** - Fundamental measurement and positioning problems
  - **2D Wall Thickness Issue**: 2D walls have no thickness, causing positioning errors
  - **Drop Position Misalignment**: Components drop relative to wall center line instead of inner face
  - **Overlap Problem**: Components appear to overlap walls due to positioning against center line
  - **Measurement Skew**: Room appears smaller in 3D than 2D due to wall thickness differences
  - **Impact**: Inaccurate designs, components placed incorrectly, measurement inconsistencies
  - **Priority**: HIGHEST - affects all room layouts and component positioning

- [ ] **Component Boundary & Rotation System Overhaul** - Multiple interconnected positioning issues
  - **Rotation Boundary Problem**: Component boundaries don't rotate with the component
  - **Drag Image vs 2D Component Mismatch**: Different sizes/constraints between preview and actual placement
  - **Corner Positioning Bug**: Only works in 2/4 corners (related to boundary calculation)
  - **Solution Consideration**: May need separate horizontal/vertical models for accurate placement
  - **Impact**: Users cannot accurately position or rotate components
  - **Priority**: HIGHEST - core functionality broken

### üî¥ HIGH PRIORITY - Dependent on Architecture Fixes
- [x] ‚úÖ **Wall Unit Load Issue** - Component timing/race condition causes loading failures
  - Root cause: Database components not loaded when sidebar renders
  - Impact: Users see "NO WALL UNITS AVAILABLE" error
  - **RESOLVED IN PHASE 4.3** - Performance optimization complete
  - **NOTE**: One harmless console error remains during initial load (see Known Issues)
- [x] ‚úÖ **Maximum Update Depth Exceeded** - Console errors when adding new projects
  - Location: ProjectContext.tsx useEffect dependency issues
  - Impact: Console warnings, potential performance issues
  - **RESOLVED IN PHASE 4.4** - ProjectContext performance optimization complete
- [x] ‚úÖ **"User Not Authorized" Red Popup** - Appears briefly on app load
  - Impact: Looks like an error to users, poor UX
  - Root cause: Authentication check before context fully loads
  - **RESOLVED IN PHASE 4.1** - Loading sequence optimization complete
- [ ] **Slow Account Activation** - New accounts take too long to gain app access
  - Impact: Poor onboarding experience, users may think signup failed
  - Root cause: Email validation ‚Üí database sync ‚Üí auth token refresh delay
  - **MOVED TO PHASE 4** - Authentication flow optimization
  - **PRIORITY: END OF PHASE** - Test after other optimizations (may be resolved)
- [x] ‚úÖ **Projects Don't Load on First Login** - Existing projects invisible until browser refresh
  - Impact: Users think their projects are lost, confusion and frustration
  - Root cause: Project data not loaded when dashboard renders
  - **RESOLVED IN PHASE 4.2** - Data loading sequence optimization complete

### üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY - Database Migration Completion
- [x] ‚úÖ **Phase 1: Database Schema Expansion** - COMPLETED
- [x] ‚úÖ **Phase 2: Service Layer & Code Refactoring** - COMPLETED  
- [x] ‚úÖ **Phase 3: Legacy Code Cleanup** - COMPLETED
  - Removed hardcoded components.tsx (558 lines)
  - Removed duplicate ComponentDefinition interfaces
  - Updated CompactComponentSidebar to use DatabaseComponent
  - Restored missing 3D model exports
  - 100% database-driven component system achieved
- [x] ‚úÖ **Phase 4: Performance Optimization** - COMPLETE (8/8 Complete)
  - **PROGRESS:**
    1. ‚úÖ Loading sequence optimization ("User Not Authorized" popup) - COMPLETE
    2. ‚úÖ Project data loading (projects not visible on first login) - COMPLETE
    3. ‚úÖ Component loading race conditions (wall units not available) - COMPLETE
    4. ‚úÖ ProjectContext performance (update depth exceeded errors) - COMPLETE
    5. ‚úÖ Database query optimization and intelligent caching - COMPLETE
    6. ‚úÖ UI/UX Polish (Performance Monitor, dev tools, scrollbar fixes) - COMPLETE
    7. ‚úÖ 3D rendering performance improvements - COMPLETE (Adaptive 3D Rendering)
    8. ‚úÖ Bundle optimization and memory management - COMPLETE (47% smaller bundles)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è KNOWN ISSUES - Non-Critical
- **Initial Component Loading Console Error** - Harmless race condition during app startup
  - Error: "WALL UNITS CATEGORY MISSING FROM FINAL GROUPS!" appears once during initial load
  - Root cause: Component filtering runs before database fetch completes
  - Impact: None - error resolves automatically when components load
  - Status: Documented, not fixing - does not affect functionality
  - User impact: Only visible in developer console, invisible to end users

- [ ] **2D Elevation Views Implementation** - BLOCKED until architecture fixes complete
  - **Dependency**: Requires accurate 2D/3D dimension consistency first
  - **Scope**: Front, back, left, right elevation views with proper component rendering
  - **Current Issues**: Tall units show as base height, corner doors on wrong elevations
  - **Status**: POSTPONED until core positioning system is fixed

### üü¢ LOW PRIORITY - Enhancements
- [ ] **Component Model Updates** - Some components still have "DB" prefix
- [ ] **3D View Enhancements** - Better lighting and materials
- [ ] **Mobile Responsiveness** - Touch drag and drop support
- [ ] **Authentication Flow Testing** - Test if login/signup optimizations still needed (moved from Phase 4.9)

### üõ°Ô∏è DEVELOPMENT PROCESS - Infrastructure
- [ ] **Cursor AI Safety Rules** - Create persistent AI guidelines in Cursor settings
  - Terminal safety protocols (stop when output not visible)
  - Git operation restrictions (user handles all git commands)
  - Error handling procedures (ask before proceeding when uncertain)
  - Development workflow guidelines (safe branches, backlog updates)
