### üî¥ CRITICAL PRIORITY - Core Architecture Issues

- [ ] **URGENT: Production Deployment Crash Investigation** - Ceiling height implementation crashes production
  - **Issue**: Recent ceiling height control feature causes complete production app crash on load
  - **Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è REVERTED (commit 02d9bea) - Production restored to stable state
  - **Local vs Production**: Feature works perfectly locally, crashes in production environment
  - **Potential Causes**: 
    - Three.js "BatchedMesh" export warning during production build
    - Environment-specific minification/bundling issues
    - Memory constraints or resource allocation differences
    - Unhandled production-specific error conditions
  - **Investigation Required**: 
    - Production error logs and stack traces
    - Build environment comparison (Node.js, npm versions)
    - Three.js version compatibility check
    - Error boundary implementation for graceful fallback
  - **Impact**: CRITICAL - blocks deployment of ceiling height feature
  - **Priority**: URGENT - must resolve before any new feature deployment
  - **Next Steps**: Investigate production logs, test production build locally, identify root cause
- [ ] **2D/3D Room Dimension Inconsistency** - Fundamental measurement and positioning problems
  - ‚úÖ **2D Wall Thickness Issue**: FIXED - 2D now renders walls with proper 10cm thickness
  - ‚úÖ **Drop Position Alignment**: FIXED - Components now drop relative to wall inner face (5cm clearance)
  - ‚úÖ **3D Coordinate Mapping**: FIXED - Proper conversion from 2D inner space to 3D coordinates
  - ‚úÖ **Wall Snapping System**: IMPLEMENTED - Smart wall detection with precise positioning
  - ‚ùå **Wide Component Wall Snapping**: PARTIAL - Front/back walls work, left/right still have 1cm offset
  - **Impact**: Most positioning issues resolved, minor precision adjustments needed
  - **Priority**: HIGH - core functionality 90% complete, minor refinements needed

- [x] ‚úÖ **Dynamic Corner System Breakthrough** - COMPLETED (December 2024)

- [ ] **3D View Ceiling Height Control Not Working** - Room height control works in elevation but not 3D
  - **Issue**: Properties panel ceiling height control has no effect in 3D view
  - **Status**: Interface updated, database storage working, elevation views work correctly
  - **Root Cause**: 3D view components not re-rendering when ceiling height changes
  - **Investigation Needed**: React state/props updates, 3D component lifecycle, Three.js mesh updates
  - **Impact**: Users cannot see ceiling height changes in 3D mode
  - **Priority**: HIGH - affects 3D room visualization accuracy
  - **Workaround**: Users can see changes in elevation views

### üî¥ HIGH PRIORITY - Dependent on Architecture Fixes
- [x] ‚úÖ **Wall Unit Load Issue** - Component timing/race condition causes loading failures
  - Root cause: Database components not loaded when sidebar renders
  - Impact: Users see "NO WALL UNITS AVAILABLE" error
  - **RESOLVED IN PHASE 4.3** - Performance optimization complete
  - **NOTE**: One harmless console error remains during initial load (see Known Issues)
- [x] ‚úÖ **Maximum Update Depth Exceeded** - Console errors when adding new projects
  - Location: ProjectContext.tsx useEffect dependency issues
  - Impact: Console warnings, potential performance issues
  - **RESOLVED IN PHASE 4.4** - ProjectContext performance optimization complete
- [x] ‚úÖ **"User Not Authorized" Red Popup** - Appears briefly on app load
  - Impact: Looks like an error to users, poor UX
  - Root cause: Authentication check before context fully loads
  - **RESOLVED IN PHASE 4.1** - Loading sequence optimization complete
- [ ] **Slow Account Activation** - New accounts take too long to gain app access
  - Impact: Poor onboarding experience, users may think signup failed
  - Root cause: Email validation ‚Üí database sync ‚Üí auth token refresh delay
  - **MOVED TO PHASE 4** - Authentication flow optimization
  - **PRIORITY: END OF PHASE** - Test after other optimizations (may be resolved)
- [x] ‚úÖ **Projects Don't Load on First Login** - Existing projects invisible until browser refresh
  - Impact: Users think their projects are lost, confusion and frustration
  - Root cause: Project data not loaded when dashboard renders
  - **RESOLVED IN PHASE 4.2** - Data loading sequence optimization complete

### üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY - Database Migration Completion

### ‚ö†Ô∏è KNOWN ISSUES - Non-Critical
- **Initial Component Loading Console Error** - Harmless race condition during app startup
  - Error: "WALL UNITS CATEGORY MISSING FROM FINAL GROUPS!" appears once during initial load
  - Root cause: Component filtering runs before database fetch completes
  - Impact: None - error resolves automatically when components load
  - Status: Documented, not fixing - does not affect functionality
  - User impact: Only visible in developer console, invisible to end users

- [ ] **2D Elevation Views Implementation** - BLOCKED until architecture fixes complete
  - **Dependency**: Requires accurate 2D/3D dimension consistency first
  - **Scope**: Front, back, left, right elevation views with proper component rendering
  - **Current Issues**: Tall units show as base height, corner doors on wrong elevations
  - **Status**: POSTPONED until core positioning system is fixed
