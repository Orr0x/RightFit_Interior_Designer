# 🚨 START HERE - Next Session

**Date:** January 13, 2025
**Session Status:** Phase 1 is 80% complete - BLOCKED by elevation view bug

---

## 🐛 URGENT BUG TO FIX

**Problem:** Components visible in elevation views but all stacked at the same position

**What Works:**
- ✅ Plan view (2D top-down)
- ✅ Component dropping
- ✅ 3D view

**What's Broken:**
- ❌ Elevation views show components but positions are wrong (stacking/overlapping)

## 🎯 Quick Start - Next Session

### 1. Pull Latest Code
```bash
git checkout feature/coordinate-system-setup
git pull origin feature/coordinate-system-setup
```

### 2. Start Dev Server
```bash
npm run dev
# Opens on http://localhost:5173
```

### 3. Test the Bug
1. Drop 3-4 components in plan view at different positions
2. Switch to front elevation view
3. Notice: Components are visible but stacked/overlapping

### 4. Start Debugging
Follow the debug plan in `HANDOVER-2025-01-13.md` section "Debugging the Elevation View Issue"

## 📊 What We Accomplished

**10 Commits Pushed** to `feature/coordinate-system-setup` branch:

✅ **Phase 1.1** - Removed wall thickness (~60 lines)
✅ **Phase 1.2** - Centralized corner detection (~200 lines)
✅ **Phase 1.3** - Removed double snapping (~130 lines)
✅ **Phase 1.4** - Documented snap thresholds
⚠️ **Phase 1.5** - Started coordinate system consolidation (HAS BUGS)

**Total:** ~450 lines of duplicate code removed, better performance, cleaner architecture

## 🎯 Three Options for Next Session

### Option 1: Fix the Bug (Recommended - 2-4 hours)
Debug and fix elevation view positioning
- See debug plan in handover doc
- Most thorough approach

### Option 2: Rollback Phase 1.5 (Quick - 1 hour)
Remove Phase 1.5 changes entirely
- Get to stable state quickly
- Defer coordinate system fix

### Option 3: Continue to Phase 2 (Not Recommended)
Leave bug for later, start new work
- Not recommended
- Better to fix first
