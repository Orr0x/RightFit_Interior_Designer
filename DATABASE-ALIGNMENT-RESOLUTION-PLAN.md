# Database-Application Alignment Resolution Plan

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive, step-by-step plan to resolve the database-application alignment issues identified in the analysis. The plan ensures safe migration from the legacy single-room design system to the new multi-room project architecture.

## Pre-Execution Checklist

### ✅ Prerequisites Verification
- [ ] **Database Access**: Confirm access to Supabase dashboard with admin privileges
- [ ] **Backup Capability**: Verify ability to create and restore database backups
- [ ] **Migration Files**: Confirm all migration files are present and readable
- [ ] **Application Status**: Verify application is currently showing migration error messages
- [ ] **User Data**: Identify if there are existing designs that need to be preserved

### ✅ Risk Mitigation Setup
- [ ] **Full Database Backup**: Create complete backup before starting
- [ ] **Test Environment**: Set up test database with copy of production data (recommended)
- [ ] **Rollback Scripts**: Prepare rollback procedures (see Appendix A)
- [ ] **Monitoring**: Set up error monitoring during migration process

## Phase 1: Database Migration Deployment

### Step 1.1: Pre-Migration Database State Check
**Objective**: Understand current database state and existing data

**Actions**:
1. **Connect to Supabase Dashboard**
   - Navigate to your project dashboard
   - Go to SQL Editor

2. **Check Current Schema**
   ```sql
   -- Check if new tables already exist
   SELECT table_name 
   FROM information_schema.tables 
   WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
   AND table_name IN ('projects', 'room_designs');
   
   -- Check existing designs count
   SELECT COUNT(*) as design_count FROM public.designs;
   
   -- Check room types in existing designs
   SELECT room_type, COUNT(*) as count 
   FROM public.designs 
   GROUP BY room_type;
   ```

3. **Document Current State**
   - Record number of existing designs
   - Note room types in use
   - Identify any custom room types not in migration

**Expected Result**: Understanding of current data volume and structure

### Step 1.2: Deploy Migration 20250908160000 (Create New Schema)
**Objective**: Create the new multi-room project tables

**Actions**:
1. **Open Migration File**
   - Navigate to `supabase/migrations/20250908160000_create_multi_room_schema.sql`
   - Copy the entire contents

2. **Execute in SQL Editor**
   - Paste the migration SQL into Supabase SQL Editor
   - Execute the migration
   - Verify no errors occurred

3. **Verify New Tables Created**
   ```sql
   -- Verify tables exist
   SELECT table_name 
   FROM information_schema.tables 
   WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
   AND table_name IN ('projects', 'room_designs');
   
   -- Check table structures
   \d public.projects
   \d public.room_designs
   ```

**Expected Result**: New `projects` and `room_designs` tables exist with proper structure

### Step 1.3: Deploy Migration 20250908160001 (Migrate Existing Data)
**Objective**: Migrate existing designs to new project structure

**Actions**:
1. **Pre-Migration Data Check**
   ```sql
   -- Count designs to be migrated
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.designs;
   ```

2. **Execute Migration**
   - Open `supabase/migrations/20250908160001_migrate_existing_designs.sql`
   - Copy and execute in SQL Editor
   - Monitor for any errors or warnings

3. **Verify Migration Success**
   ```sql
   -- Check migration results
   SELECT COUNT(*) as project_count FROM public.projects;
   SELECT COUNT(*) as room_design_count FROM public.room_designs;
   
   -- Verify data integrity
   SELECT 
     p.name as project_name,
     rd.room_type,
     rd.name as room_name,
     jsonb_array_length(rd.design_elements) as element_count
   FROM public.projects p
   JOIN public.room_designs rd ON p.id = rd.project_id
   ORDER BY p.created_at DESC
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

**Expected Result**: All existing designs migrated to new structure without data loss

### Step 1.4: Post-Migration Verification
**Objective**: Ensure migration completed successfully and data integrity is maintained

**Actions**:
1. **Data Integrity Check**
   ```sql
   -- Verify all designs were migrated
   SELECT 
     (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.designs) as original_designs,
     (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.room_designs WHERE design_settings ? 'migrated') as migrated_designs;
   
   -- Check for any failed migrations
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.designs d
   WHERE NOT EXISTS (
     SELECT 1 FROM public.room_designs rd
     WHERE rd.design_settings->>'original_design_id' = d.id::text
   );
   ```

2. **RLS Policy Verification**
   ```sql
   -- Test RLS policies work correctly
   SELECT policy_name, table_name 
   FROM information_schema.table_privileges 
   WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
   AND table_name IN ('projects', 'room_designs');
   ```

**Expected Result**: All data migrated successfully, no orphaned records, RLS policies active

## Phase 2: Application Testing and Verification

### Step 2.1: Application Restart and Initial Testing
**Objective**: Verify application can now connect to new database schema

**Actions**:
1. **Refresh Application**
   - Refresh the browser page
   - Check browser console for any errors
   - Verify no more "Database Setup Required" messages

2. **Test Basic Functionality**
   - Try to load the project dashboard
   - Verify existing projects appear (migrated data)
   - Check that project counts are correct

**Expected Result**: Application loads without database errors, shows migrated projects

### Step 2.2: Project Management Testing
**Objective**: Verify core project operations work correctly

**Actions**:
1. **Test Project Creation**
   - Create a new project with name and description
   - Verify project appears in dashboard
   - Check project details are saved correctly

2. **Test Project Loading**
   - Click on an existing (migrated) project
   - Verify project loads without errors
   - Check that room designs are displayed

3. **Test Project Updates**
   - Edit project name and description
   - Verify changes are saved
   - Check updated timestamp

**Expected Result**: All project CRUD operations work correctly

### Step 2.3: Room Design Testing
**Objective**: Verify room design functionality works with new schema

**Actions**:
1. **Test Room Creation**
   - Create a new room design in a project
   - Try different room types
   - Verify room appears in room tabs

2. **Test Room Switching**
   - Switch between different rooms in a project
   - Verify room-specific data loads correctly
   - Check that design elements are room-specific

3. **Test Design Saving**
   - Make changes to a room design
   - Save the design
   - Verify changes persist after page refresh

**Expected Result**: All room design operations work correctly

### Step 2.4: Data Migration Verification
**Objective**: Ensure migrated data is accessible and functional

**Actions**:
1. **Test Migrated Projects**
   - Open projects that were migrated from old designs
   - Verify all design elements are present
   - Check that room dimensions are correct

2. **Test Design Elements**
   - Verify cabinets, appliances, and walls display correctly
   - Check that element properties (position, size, rotation) are preserved
   - Test element manipulation (move, resize, rotate)

3. **Test Legacy Compatibility**
   - Verify old design data structure still works
   - Check that migrated designs can be edited and saved

**Expected Result**: All migrated data is fully functional and editable

## Phase 3: Performance and Stability Testing

### Step 3.1: Performance Testing
**Objective**: Ensure new schema performs adequately

**Actions**:
1. **Load Testing**
   - Test with multiple projects (10+)
   - Test with projects containing multiple rooms
   - Measure project loading times

2. **Database Query Performance**
   ```sql
   -- Test query performance
   EXPLAIN ANALYZE 
   SELECT p.*, rd.* 
   FROM projects p 
   LEFT JOIN room_designs rd ON p.id = rd.project_id 
   WHERE p.user_id = 'user-id-here';
   ```

**Expected Result**: Performance meets acceptable thresholds (< 2s for project loading)

### Step 3.2: Error Handling Testing
**Objective**: Verify error handling works correctly with new schema

**Actions**:
1. **Test Invalid Operations**
   - Try to create duplicate room types in same project
   - Test with invalid room type values
   - Test with malformed JSON data

2. **Test Network Issues**
   - Test behavior with poor network connection
   - Verify error messages are user-friendly
   - Check that partial saves don't corrupt data

**Expected Result**: Graceful error handling, no data corruption

## Phase 4: Cleanup and Documentation

### Step 4.1: Legacy Table Management
**Objective**: Decide what to do with old designs table

**Options**:
1. **Keep as Backup** (Recommended)
   ```sql
   -- Rename for clarity
   ALTER TABLE public.designs RENAME TO designs_legacy_backup;
   
   -- Add comment
   COMMENT ON TABLE public.designs_legacy_backup IS 
   'Backup of original designs table before multi-room migration on [DATE]';
   ```

2. **Archive and Remove** (After verification period)
   ```sql
   -- Export data first, then drop
   -- DROP TABLE public.designs_legacy_backup;
   ```

### Step 4.2: Update Documentation
**Objective**: Update project documentation to reflect new schema

**Actions**:
1. **Update README.md** with new database schema information
2. **Update API documentation** if applicable
3. **Create migration notes** for future reference
4. **Update deployment guides** with migration procedures

## Rollback Procedures (Emergency Use Only)

### If Migration Fails During Step 1.2 (Schema Creation)
```sql
-- Drop new tables if they were created
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS public.room_designs;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS public.projects;

-- Restore from backup if needed
```

### If Migration Fails During Step 1.3 (Data Migration)
```sql
-- Clear partially migrated data
DELETE FROM public.room_designs;
DELETE FROM public.projects;

-- Drop new tables
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS public.room_designs;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS public.projects;

-- Application will fall back to legacy mode
```

### If Application Issues After Migration
1. **Immediate**: Revert application code to previous version
2. **Database**: Keep new schema but fix application issues
3. **Last Resort**: Full rollback to legacy schema
