# Legacy Designer Components

This folder contains designer components that were moved from the main codebase for testing purposes.

## Moved Files

### `DesignCanvas2D_interface.tsx`
- **Status:** ✅ **SAFE TO REMOVE** - No imports found anywhere in codebase
- **Issue:** Redundant interface definition with conflicting tape measure props
- **Original Location:** `src/components/designer/DesignCanvas2D_interface.tsx`
- **Reason:** Interface already defined in `DesignCanvas2D.tsx` with different tape measure props
- **Action:** Can be permanently deleted

### `View3D.tsx`
- **Status:** ✅ **SAFE TO REMOVE** - No imports found anywhere in codebase  
- **Issue:** Potentially legacy 3D view component
- **Original Location:** `src/components/designer/View3D.tsx`
- **Reason:** Superseded by `AdaptiveView3D.tsx` (used by `Lazy3DView.tsx`)
- **Action:** Can be permanently deleted

## Testing Results

- ✅ **Build Test:** `npm run build` completed successfully
- ✅ **Import Check:** No imports found for either file
- ✅ **No Breaking Changes:** Application continues to work normally

## Next Steps

These files can be permanently deleted as they are:
1. Not imported anywhere in the codebase
2. Not causing any build errors
3. Redundant or superseded by other components

## Restoration

If needed, files can be restored by moving them back to `src/components/designer/`:
```bash
# Restore DesignCanvas2D_interface.tsx
move docs\src-components-legacy\designer\DesignCanvas2D_interface.tsx src\components\designer\

# Restore View3D.tsx  
move docs\src-components-legacy\designer\View3D.tsx src\components\designer\
```
