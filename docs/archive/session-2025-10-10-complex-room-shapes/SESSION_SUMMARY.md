# Complex Room Shapes Implementation - Session Summary
## Date: 2025-10-10

## Overview
Complete implementation of complex room geometry system (L-shaped, U-shaped) with database-driven templates, manual wall visibility controls, and first-person walk mode.

## Implementation Phases Completed

### Phase 1: Database Schema & Room Geometry Type ✅
**Location:** `supabase/migrations/20250915000003_phase1_seed_geometry_templates.sql`

**What was built:**
- Created `room_geometry_templates` table with polygon vertex storage
- RoomGeometry TypeScript interface with proper typing
- Seed data for 3 template types:
  - `rectangular` (400×300cm)
  - `l_shaped_standard` (600×450cm with 200×150cm cutout)
  - `u_shaped_standard` (700×400cm with two 150cm wing sections)

**Schema Structure:**
```typescript
interface RoomGeometry {
  id: string;
  template_name: string;
  shape_type: 'rectangular' | 'l_shaped' | 'u_shaped' | 'custom';
  floor: {
    vertices: [number, number][]; // Polygon vertices in cm
    elevation: number;
  };
  walls: Array<{
    id?: string;
    start: [number, number];
    end: [number, number];
    height: number;
    thickness?: number;
  }>;
  ceiling?: {
    vertices: [number, number][];
    elevation: number;
  } | null;
  bounding_box: {
    min_x: number;
    max_x: number;
    min_y: number;
    max_y: number;
  };
  metadata?: {
    total_floor_area: number;
    perimeter_length: number;
  };
}
```

### Phase 2: Room Service Integration ✅
**Location:** `src/services/RoomService.ts`

**What was built:**
- `loadRoomGeometry(templateId)` - Fetch geometry from Supabase
- `loadRoomColors(roomId)` - Fetch custom colors (floor/walls/ceiling)
- Database queries with proper error handling
- Integration with existing room structure

### Phase 3: ComplexRoomGeometry Component ✅
**Location:** `src/components/3d/ComplexRoomGeometry.tsx`

**What was built:**
- **PolygonFloor:** Renders floor from polygon vertices using ShapeGeometry
- **WallSegment:** Renders individual wall segments with proper positioning
- **FlatCeiling:** Renders ceiling from polygon vertices (optional)
- **Center offset calculation:** Centers room at origin (0,0,0) for proper camera positioning
- **Manual wall visibility controls:**
  - `hiddenWalls: string[]` - Array of directions to hide ('north', 'south', 'east', 'west')
  - `hideInterior: boolean` - Toggle for interior/return walls
  - `showCeiling: boolean` - Toggle for ceiling visibility
- **Perimeter detection:** Bounding box edge detection (5cm tolerance) to identify interior vs perimeter walls

**Key Features:**
- ShapeGeometry for efficient polygon rendering (2-20 triangles vs 10-100+)
- Quality-based material selection (MeshBasicMaterial for low, MeshLambertMaterial for medium/high)
- DoubleSide rendering for proper visibility
- Room dimensions text overlay (disabled in low quality)

**Critical Fixes:**
- Fixed floor/ceiling double-centering offset (removed centering from shape, positioned mesh instead)
- Fixed ceiling height to use wall height (not floating above)
- Fixed floor rotation (Math.PI/2 for correct orientation)

### Phase 4: UI Integration - Wall Visibility Controls ✅
**Location:** `src/components/designer/AdaptiveView3D.tsx`

**What was built:**
- **Manual wall toggle buttons:**
  - N, S, E, W buttons for individual perimeter walls
  - "All" button (show all walls)
  - "None" button (hide all walls)
  - "Interior" button (toggle return walls in L/U-shapes)
  - "Ceiling" button (show/hide ceiling)
- **Visual feedback:** Filled button = visible, outline = hidden
- **Conditional rendering:** Only shows for complex room geometry (not simple rectangular rooms)
- **Top-center toolbar:** Professional UI with backdrop blur and shadow

**State Management:**
```typescript
const [hiddenWalls, setHiddenWalls] = useState<string[]>([]);
const [hideInterior, setHideInterior] = useState(false);
const [showCeiling, setShowCeiling] = useState(false);
```

### Phase 5: First-Person Walk Mode ✅
**Location:** `src/components/designer/AdaptiveView3D.tsx` (FirstPersonControls component)

**What was built:**
- **Eye-level camera:** Spawns at room center (0, 1.7, 0) - 170cm height
- **WASD movement controls:**
  - W: Move forward
  - S: Move backward
  - A: Strafe left
  - D: Strafe right
- **Mouse look:** Pointer Lock API for FPS-style camera rotation
- **Pitch clamping:** Prevents camera from flipping upside down
- **Movement speed:** 0.05 units per frame (~60fps)
- **Look speed:** 0.002 radians per pixel
- **OrbitControls integration:** Automatically disabled during walk mode
- **Instructions overlay:** Visual guide for users

**Movement Calculations:**
```typescript
// Forward vector (negated Z for correct direction)
const forward = new THREE.Vector3(
  -Math.sin(yaw),
  0,
  -Math.cos(yaw)
);

// Right vector (perpendicular to forward)
const right = new THREE.Vector3(
  Math.cos(yaw),
  0,
  -Math.sin(yaw)
);
```

### Phase 6: Room Shape Selector UI ✅
**Location:** `src/components/designer/RoomShapeSelector.tsx`

**What was built:**
- Modal dialog for choosing room shape
- Three template options:
  - Rectangular (default, 400×300cm)
  - L-Shaped (600×450cm)
  - U-Shaped (700×400cm)
- Visual previews for each shape (SVG icons)
- Loads geometry from database on selection
- Updates ProjectContext with new geometry

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Automatic Wall Hiding Logic Failed
**Problem:** Initial implementation used 8-direction camera-based system to automatically hide walls based on viewing angle. This was hiding the wrong walls for L-shaped rooms.

**Root Cause:**
- L-shaped rooms have interior "return walls" that don't fit into simple N/S/E/W classification
- Camera angle detection was unreliable for complex geometries
- System was overcomplicated

**Solution:**
- Pivoted to manual toggle system at user's request
- Added individual N/S/E/W buttons for perimeter walls
- Added separate "Interior" toggle for return walls
- Implemented bounding box edge detection (5cm tolerance) to classify walls

**User Feedback:**
> "I think we should simplify the wall removal and add the ability to turn on and off each wall manually"

### Challenge 2: Floor/Ceiling Positioning Offset
**Problem:** Floor and ceiling were offset from origin, causing camera positioning issues.

**Root Cause:**
- Double-centering: Centering vertices in shape AND positioning mesh
- This caused the visual geometry to be offset from (0,0,0)

**Solution:**
- Removed centering from shape creation
- Calculate center offset from bounding box
- Position mesh using centerOffset to place room at origin
- This ensures camera at (0,0,0) is in the center of the room

**Code Change:**
```typescript
// Calculate center offset
const centerOffset = useMemo(() => {
  const box = new THREE.Box3().setFromPoints(
    geometry.floor.vertices.map(v => new THREE.Vector3(v[0] / 100, 0, v[1] / 100))
  );
  const center = new THREE.Vector3();
  box.getCenter(center);
  return { x: -center.x, z: -center.z };
}, [geometry.floor.vertices]);

// Position mesh (not centered in shape)
<mesh position={[centerOffset.x, -0.001, centerOffset.z]} />
```

### Challenge 3: WASD Movement Direction Inverted
**Problem:** W moved backward, S moved forward initially. After fix, A/D were inverted.

**Root Cause:**
- Three.js coordinate system: Z-axis points toward camera in default setup
- Forward vector calculation needed negation for correct direction
- Right vector needed different negation pattern

**Solution (Final):**
```typescript
// Forward: negate both X and Z components
const forward = new THREE.Vector3(-Math.sin(yaw), 0, -Math.cos(yaw));

// Right: negate only Z component
const right = new THREE.Vector3(Math.cos(yaw), 0, -Math.sin(yaw));
```

### Challenge 4: Walk Mode Spawn Position Outside Room
**Problem:** Camera spawned at previous orbit position when entering walk mode.

**Solution:**
- Set camera position explicitly to (0, 1.7, 0) on walk mode enable
- This places camera at room center at eye level
- Works because ComplexRoomGeometry centers room at origin

## Performance Optimizations

1. **ShapeGeometry vs ExtrudeGeometry:**
   - Floor/ceiling use ShapeGeometry (2-20 triangles)
   - Alternative was ExtrudeGeometry (10-100+ triangles)
   - ~5-10x fewer triangles for same visual result

2. **Quality-based materials:**
   - Low quality: MeshBasicMaterial (no lighting calculations)
   - Medium/High: MeshLambertMaterial (diffuse lighting)
   - Conditional text rendering (disabled in low quality)

3. **useMemo hooks:**
   - Floor/ceiling geometry memoized by vertices
   - Wall data memoized by position/dimensions
   - Center offset memoized by floor vertices
   - Prevents recalculation on every render

4. **Movement loop optimization:**
   - 60fps interval (16ms) for smooth movement
   - Direct vector calculations (no matrix operations)
   - Minimal state updates per frame

## Known Limitations

1. **No collision detection:** Users can walk through walls in walk mode
2. **No custom polygon editor:** Can only use predefined templates
3. **No custom wall heights:** All walls use same height per room
4. **No wall openings:** Doors/windows not yet supported
5. **Static templates:** Must edit database to add new room shapes
