## Remaining 40 Components - Analysis

The automatic fix worked perfectly for 136 components, but 40 components need special handling because they fall into these categories:

### Category 1: Corner Cabinets (2 components)
**Issue:** `default_height` stored in CENTIMETERS (70, 90) not meters (0.70, 0.90)

```
l-shaped-test-cabinet-90        90.0000 cm (not 0.90m)
new-corner-wall-cabinet-60      70.0000 cm (not 0.70m)
new-corner-wall-cabinet-90      70.0000 cm (not 0.70m)
```

**Fix:** Use value directly (already in cm)

---

### Category 2: Wall Cabinets (5 components)
**Issue:** `default_height` shows 60cm but standard wall cabinets should be 70cm

```
wall-cabinet-30    default: 0.60m  should be: 70cm (140-210cm range)
wall-cabinet-40    default: 0.60m  should be: 70cm
wall-cabinet-50    default: 0.60m  should be: 70cm
wall-cabinet-60    default: 0.60m  should be: 70cm
wall-cabinet-80    default: 0.60m  should be: 70cm
```

**Fix:** Set to standard 70cm wall cabinet height

---

### Category 3: Sinks (20 components)
**Issue:** Sinks are INSET into countertops with negative `min_height_cm` values

**Why Negative Heights?**
- Sinks are recessed INTO the countertop
- The model shows them "dipping below" the counter surface
- For elevation views, we need to show them at countertop level

**Examples:**
```
sink-60                        20cm deep, inset into 90cm counter
kitchen-sink-undermount-60     18cm deep (shallower)
butler-sink-60                 25cm deep (deeper farmhouse style)
butler-sink-deep-60            30cm deep (extra deep)
```

**Fix:** Calculate proper min/max based on sink depth
- Standard sinks (20cm): 70-90cm
- Undermount (18cm): 72-90cm
- Butler (25cm): 65-90cm
- Deep butler (30cm): 60-90cm

---

### Category 4: Cornices (4 components)
**Issue:** Cornices are ceiling-mounted decorative trim with negative heights

```
cornice-60     10cm tall, mounts at ceiling (220cm)
cornice-80     10cm tall, mounts at ceiling
cornice-100    10cm tall, mounts at ceiling
cornice-120    10cm tall, mounts at ceiling
```

**Fix:** Set to 210-220cm (hanging from ceiling)

---

### Category 5: Utility Worktops (3 components)
**Issue:** These are full-height utility room worktops, not standard countertops

```
utility-worktop-80     90cm height
utility-worktop-100    90cm height
utility-worktop-120    90cm height
```

**Fix:** Set to 0-90cm (floor to counter height)

---

### Category 6: Windows (3 components)
**Issue:** Special window types with non-standard mounting

```
window-bay-240        150cm tall bay window (90-240cm)
window-double-150     140cm tall window (90-230cm)
skylight-80x120       10cm thick skylight at ceiling (220-230cm)
```

**Fix:** Set appropriate min/max for each window type

---

## Next Steps

### Execute Second Fix Script

1. Open Supabase SQL Editor
2. Run `FIX_REMAINING_40_COMPONENTS.sql`
3. Review verification results

**Expected Results After Second Fix:**
```
✅ MATCH: 176 components (136 + 40)
⚠️ CM NOT METERS: 2 components (corner cabinets - acceptable)
⚠️ NO LAYER TYPE: 22 components (expected)
❌ MISMATCH: 0 components
```

### Browser Testing After Second Fix

Test these specific components in elevation views:

1. **Wall Cabinets** - Should be 70cm tall (140-210cm range)
2. **Sinks** - Should appear at countertop level (90cm)
3. **Cornices** - Should appear at ceiling level
4. **Bay Windows** - Should span from 90cm to correct height

---

## Why Two Fix Scripts?

**First Script (Automatic):**
- Handles 90% of components (136/176)
- Simple rule: `max_height_cm = default_height * 100`
- Works for standard components where `default_height` is in meters

**Second Script (Targeted):**
- Handles special cases (40/176)
- Components with non-standard data:
  - Heights in cm not m
  - Inset components (sinks)
  - Ceiling-mounted (cornices)
  - Non-standard mounting (windows)
