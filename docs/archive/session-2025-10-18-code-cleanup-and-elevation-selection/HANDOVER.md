# Handover Document: Code Cleanup & Elevation Selection Session

**Date:** October 18, 2025
**Branch:** `feature/elevation-simplified`
**Previous Agent:** Code cleanup and elevation view selection implementation
**Session Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE

---

## Executive Summary

This session completed code cleanup from the previous elevation view visibility implementation and added click selection functionality to elevation views. All work is tested, documented, and ready for merge to main.

**Key Achievement:** Elevation views now support direct click-to-select on elements with precise hit detection matching the visual rendering.

---

## What Was Completed

### 1. Code Cleanup ‚úÖ
- Removed all commented `isVisible` code (11 instances across 6 files)
- Removed all debug logging with emoji markers (11 statements across 2 files)
- Verified no orphaned code or dead references
- Organized SQL migration files into proper folder structure

### 2. UI Improvements ‚úÖ
- Reorganized Properties Panel to show Quick Actions first
- Simplified Element Selector to show visual indicators only
- Removed eye toggle from element list (kept in Properties Panel only)

### 3. Elevation View Click Selection ‚úÖ
- Fixed coordinate system conversion for elevation views
- Implemented proper hit detection using X/Z coordinates
- Made clickable areas match visual rendering precisely
- Enabled selection for all element types in elevation views

---

## Critical Technical Information

### Coordinate System (IMPORTANT)

The application uses **different coordinate systems** for plan vs elevation views:

#### Plan View
```
Canvas (pixels)          Room (cm)
    ‚Üì                      ‚Üì
   X ‚Üí X (horizontal)      X (horizontal)
   Y ‚Üí Y (depth)           Y (depth)
```
- Elements positioned by `(x, y)` with rotation
- Standard 2D coordinate system

#### Elevation Views
```
Canvas (pixels)          Room (cm)
    ‚Üì                      ‚Üì
   X ‚Üí X (horizontal)      X (horizontal)
   Y ‚Üí Z (height)          Z (height above floor)
```
- **INVERTED Y-axis:** Canvas top = ceiling, Canvas bottom = floor
- Elements positioned by `(x, z)` where z is mount height
- No rotation (elements always face forward)
- Formula: `roomZ = wallHeight - ((canvasY - innerY) / zoom)`

### Element Z Positioning (IMPORTANT)

The `z` property represents the **bottom edge** of an element above the floor:

```
Element with z=150cm, height=70cm:
    ‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê  ‚Üê Top at z+height = 220cm
    ‚îÇ          ‚îÇ
    ‚îÇ  ELEMENT ‚îÇ
    ‚îÇ          ‚îÇ
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò  ‚Üê Bottom at z = 150cm
‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ  ‚Üê Floor at z = 0cm
```

**Common Z values:**
- Base cabinets: `z=0` (floor level)
- Wall cabinets: `z=150` (standard mount height)
- Tall units: `z=0` (floor to ceiling)
- Counter tops: `z=90` (on top of base cabinets)

### Hit Detection Logic (IMPORTANT)

**Plan View:**
- Uses rotation-aware boundary detection
- Transforms click point into element's local space
- Checks if point within un-rotated bounds

**Elevation View:**
```typescript
// Horizontal check (standard)
isInHorizontalBounds = |clickX - centerX| <= width/2

// Vertical check (range-based, NOT centered)
isInVerticalBounds = clickY >= z && clickY <= z+height
```

**Why range-based?** Because z is the bottom edge, not the center. We check if the click falls within the element's vertical span from bottom (z) to top (z+height).

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Click detection offset in elevation view
**Symptom:** Have to click above/below element to select it
**Cause:** Coordinate conversion or hit detection not matching rendering
**Check:**
1. Is `canvasToRoom` inverting Y for elevation views? (line 567)
2. Is hit detection using `z` to `z+height` range? (line 2158)
3. Are both using same `wallHeight` value?

### Issue: Wall cabinets not clickable
**Symptom:** Can click base cabinets but not wall cabinets
**Cause:** Z coordinate might be 0 instead of mount height
**Check:**
1. Verify wall cabinet has `z > 0` (should be ~150)
2. Check component metadata has `min_height_cm` set
3. Verify database height fix was applied (SESSION_SUMMARY.md in previous session)

### Issue: Element selector eye icon still visible
**Symptom:** Eye toggle button appears in element list
**Cause:** Code changes not applied or old prop still passed
**Check:**
1. Verify CanvasElementCounter.tsx doesn't have eye button code (around line 190)
2. Check Designer.tsx not passing `onToggleElementVisibility` to CanvasElementCounter (lines 992-1000, 1016-1024)

## Architecture Notes for Future Work

### Current Design Decisions

**Single Visibility Control Point:**
- Visibility toggle ONLY in Properties Panel Quick Actions
- Element Selector shows read-only visual indicators
- Rationale: Avoid complexity with 3D view, single source of truth

**Per-View Visibility:**
- Each elevation view (plan, front, back, etc.) has independent `hidden_elements` array
- Stored in `design_settings.elevation_views` in database
- No global visibility flag (removed `isVisible` from DesignElement)

**Coordinate System:**
- Plan view uses X/Y (standard 2D)
- Elevation views use X/Z (inverted Y-axis)
- This matches how elements are rendered (see drawing code lines 1365-1425)

### Extension Points

**If adding elevation view dragging:**
1. Update `handleMouseMove` to convert drag delta to Z-axis movement
2. Update `onUpdateElement` to modify `z` property
3. Consider snap guides for vertical alignment
4. Reference: Plan view dragging logic (lines 2229-2280)

**If adding 3D view visibility layer:**
1. Add '3d' entry to `elevation_views` array in database
2. Update view selector to include 3D in view list
3. Add filtering logic in 3D view component
4. Consider: Should 3D have independent or derived visibility?

**If adding bulk element actions:**
1. Add multi-select state to DesignCanvas2D
2. Update click handler to support shift/ctrl modifiers
3. Add bulk actions to Quick Actions panel
4. Update visibility toggle to handle arrays

## Database Schema Reference

### design_settings.elevation_views

```typescript
type ElevationViewConfig = {
  id: string;              // 'plan', 'front-default', 'back-default', etc.
  name: string;            // Display name for UI
  direction: 'plan' | 'front' | 'back' | 'left' | 'right';
  hidden_elements: string[]; // Array of element IDs to hide in this view
};
```

**Example:**
```json
{
  "elevation_views": [
    {
      "id": "plan",
      "name": "Plan View",
      "direction": "plan",
      "hidden_elements": []
    },
    {
      "id": "front-default",
      "name": "Front Elevation",
      "direction": "front",
      "hidden_elements": ["cabinet-12", "appliance-5"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Design Element (element.z)

The `z` property was added in previous sessions:
- Type: `number` (in cm)
- Default: `0` (floor level)
- Represents: Mount height (bottom edge above floor)
- Used in: Elevation view rendering and hit detection

2. Hit detection: Same file, lines 125-171 and 2084-2162
3. UI layout: `src/components/designer/PropertiesPanel.tsx:267-306`

**To test:**
1. Use testing checklist above
2. Focus on elevation view click selection

## Questions & Contact

**If you need clarification:**
- Review SESSION_SUMMARY.md for detailed changes
- Check previous session docs for context
- Review code comments (inline documentation)
- Test in browser with console logging if needed

**Common questions answered:**
- **Why two coordinate systems?** Plan view is top-down (X/Y), elevation is side-view (X/Z)
- **Why remove eye toggle?** Single source of truth, avoid 3D view complexity
- **Why range-based hit detection?** Z is bottom edge, not center - need to check span
- **Why invert Y-axis?** Match visual rendering (top = ceiling, bottom = floor)
