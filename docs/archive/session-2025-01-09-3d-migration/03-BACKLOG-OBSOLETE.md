# ⚠️ BACKLOG - OBSOLETE
**Date:** 2025-01-09
**Status:** ⚠️ **OBSOLETE - Based on Incorrect Assessment**

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTICE

**This backlog is OBSOLETE and should not be used.**

This document was created based on an incorrect initial assessment that only ~10-15% of components had 3D models in the database.

**Reality:**
- ✅ 95% of 3D models were already in database (198 models)
- ✅ Database migration was complete
- ❌ Code integration was incomplete (2 issues)

**What Actually Needed Fixing:**
1. ComponentIDMapper patterns (35 patterns added)
2. AdaptiveView3D type routing (6 cases + improved default)

**Actual Work Completed:**
See `04-COMPLETED.md` and `09-SESSION-COMPLETION-SUMMARY.md` for what was actually done.

## Original Backlog (For Reference Only)

This file has been renamed to `03-BACKLOG-OBSOLETE.md` and preserved for reference.

The original plan called for creating 47+ new 3D models from scratch, which turned out to be unnecessary since they already existed in the database.

**See instead:**
- `05-REVISED-ASSESSMENT.md` - Corrected understanding
- `06-MULTI-ROOM-MAPPING-GAP-ANALYSIS.md` - Actual gaps identified
- `09-SESSION-COMPLETION-SUMMARY.md` - What was actually completed
