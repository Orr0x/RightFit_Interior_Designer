# Component Alignment & Positioning Overhaul - START HERE
**Date:** 2025-10-17
**Branch:** `feature/alignment-positioning-fix` (to be created)
**Status:** üìã PLANNING PHASE
**Priority:** üî¥ CRITICAL - Foundation for all future elevation view work

---

## üéØ Session Overview

### The Problem
Component placement, rotation, and alignment system has multiple issues that must be fixed before proceeding with elevation view testing:

1. **Rotation Issues** - Components don't rotate on true center
2. **Drop Position Misalignment** - Drag image doesn't match final placement
3. **Wall Overlap** - Walls render as rectangles causing visual overlap
4. **Snapping Inconsistencies** - Wall snap logic has hardcoded conflicts
5. **Bounding Box Problems** - Selection/rotation boxes don't match visual components
6. **Configuration Chaos** - Settings scattered across database, hardcoded values, and multiple services

### The Goal
Create a **single, coherent positioning system** with:
- True-center rotation for all components
- Accurate drag previews matching final placement
- Wall rendering as lines (not rectangles) to prevent overlap
- Unified configuration source (database-driven)
- Consistent snapping behavior
- Accurate bounding boxes matching visual representation

### Why This Matters
This is **blocking work** for:
- Elevation view testing (can't validate if positions are wrong)
- Complex room shapes (needs accurate positioning)
- Multi-view coordination (positions must be consistent)
- User experience (current behavior is confusing and frustrating)

## üîç Key Issues Identified

### Issue #1: Multiple Coordinate Systems üî¥ CRITICAL
**Problem:** Transformations happen at multiple points with inconsistent logic

**Current Flow:**
```
Component DB (cm)
  ‚Üí CompactComponentSidebar (drag preview px)
    ‚Üí DesignCanvas2D (canvas coordinates px)
      ‚Üí CanvasCoordinateIntegrator (room coordinates cm)
        ‚Üí Final position (cm, but may be offset)
```

**What's Wrong:**
- Drag preview uses 1.15x scale factor (line 277 in CompactComponentSidebar.tsx)
- Canvas uses different scale (zoom-dependent)
- Final position calculation may shift from drop point
- No single source of truth for coordinate mapping

**Impact:**
- User drops component at X, it appears at X + offset
- Confusing user experience
- Debugging nightmares

---

### Issue #2: Wall Rendering as Rectangles üî¥ CRITICAL
**Location:** `DesignCanvas2D.tsx`

**Problem:** Walls drawn as filled rectangles (10cm thick) overlapping with components

**Why It's Wrong:**
- Visual clutter
- Hides component boundaries
- Makes precise placement difficult
- Not how real rooms work (walls are boundaries, not objects)

**Solution:** Render walls as lines (1-2px stroke) representing inner room boundaries

---

### Issue #3: Rotation Center Mismatch üî¥ CRITICAL
**Problem:** Components rotate around visual center, but bounding box uses different center

**Evidence:**
- Selection box doesn't match rotated component
- Rotation handles in wrong positions
- Corner components especially bad

**Root Cause:** Transform origin not set to component's geometric center

---

### Issue #4: Configuration Scattered üü° MEDIUM
**Problem:** Settings defined in multiple places:

1. **Database** (`app_configuration` table):
   - `wall_thickness`: 10cm
   - `snap_threshold`: 40cm
   - `wall_clearance`: 5cm

2. **Hardcoded** (various files):
   - Drag preview scale: 1.15x (CompactComponentSidebar.tsx:277)
   - Corner threshold: 60cm (canvasCoordinateIntegration.ts:131)
   - Snap threshold: 40cm (canvasCoordinateIntegration.ts:211)
   - Wall clearance: 5cm (canvasCoordinateIntegration.ts:70)

3. **ConfigurationService** (caching layer):
   - Loads from database when feature flag enabled
   - Falls back to hardcoded values

**Why It's Bad:**
- Changes require code deployment
- Inconsistencies between sources
- No single place to update values
- Difficult to debug issues

**Goal:** ONE source of truth (database) with ConfigurationService as ONLY accessor

---

### Issue #5: Drag Preview Mismatch üü° MEDIUM
**Problem:** Drag preview size doesn't match final component size

**Current Logic:**
```typescript
// CompactComponentSidebar.tsx:277
const scaleFactor = 1.15; // "Better match canvas components"
const previewWidth = component.width * scaleFactor;
```

**Why 1.15x?** Comment says "better match" but this is a hack, not a solution

**Real Issue:** Canvas components scale with zoom, but drag preview uses fixed scale

**Solution:** Calculate preview size matching current canvas zoom level

---

### Issue #6: Corner Component Special Cases üü° MEDIUM
**Problem:** Corner logic scattered across multiple files

**Locations:**
1. `CompactComponentSidebar.tsx:283` - Corner detection for drag preview
2. `canvasCoordinateIntegration.ts:282` - Corner detection for placement
3. `canvasCoordinateIntegration.ts:124` - Corner rotation logic
4. `DesignCanvas2D.tsx` - Corner rendering (assumed, need to verify)

**Issues:**
- Multiple "isCornerComponent" checks with different logic
- Hardcoded rotation angles per corner
- Square footprint assumption

**Solution:** Single corner component service with consistent logic

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: Breaking Existing Functionality üî¥ HIGH
**Problem:** Changes may break working features

**Mitigation:**
- Feature flag for each major change
- Comprehensive testing before and after
- Keep old code paths during transition
- Incremental deployment

---

### Risk 2: Performance Degradation üü° MEDIUM
**Problem:** More calculations may slow rendering

**Mitigation:**
- Memoize expensive calculations
- Profile before and after
- Use Web Workers if needed
- Optimize critical paths

---

### Risk 3: Configuration Migration Issues üü° MEDIUM
**Problem:** Database values may conflict with hardcoded fallbacks

**Mitigation:**
- Validate all config values
- Add min/max constraints
- Test with invalid values
- Provide clear error messages

---

### Risk 4: Coordinate System Changes üî¥ HIGH
**Problem:** Changes to coordinate math may break elevation views

**Mitigation:**
- Don't change coordinate system itself
- Only fix transformations and offsets
- Test in plan view first
- Validate elevation views last

---

## üí° Key Insights

### Insight 1: Root Cause is Complexity
The positioning system has evolved organically with multiple patches and workarounds. This created a complex web of transformations that nobody fully understands.

**Solution:** Simplify by establishing clear boundaries:
- Component DB stores dimensions in cm
- Canvas works in pixels (with zoom)
- Single transformation point (not scattered)
- Clear ownership of each calculation

---

### Insight 2: Configuration Needs Preloading
Current async ConfigurationService causes race conditions and complexity.

**Solution:**
- Preload all config on app initialization
- Use synchronous getters after preload
- Cache indefinitely (only clear on explicit update)
- Fail fast if preload fails

---

### Insight 3: Walls Aren't Components
Treating walls as drawable objects (rectangles) causes confusion. Walls are room boundaries, not placeable items.

**Solution:**
- Render walls as boundaries (lines)
- Components positioned relative to inner boundaries
- Wall thickness affects room dimensions, not rendering

---

### Insight 4: Drag Preview is Critical UX
Users expect preview to match final result. Any mismatch breaks trust and feels broken.

**Solution:**
- Preview must be pixel-perfect match
- Account for canvas zoom
- Show rotation in preview (future)
- Visual feedback for snap zones (future)
