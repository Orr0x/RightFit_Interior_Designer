### 1.2 Current Project State

**Project Name**: RightFit Interior Designer

**Current State Summary**:

RightFit Interior Designer is a professional-grade interior design application built with React, TypeScript, and Supabase. It provides multi-room project management with advanced 2D multi-view planning (plan view + 4 elevation views) and immersive 3D visualization using Three.js.

**Current Maturity**: ~90% feature-complete (user assessment)

**Technical Status**:
- **Functional**: Application works for core use cases
- **Unstable**: 5 circular dependency patterns cause AI coding loops
- **High Technical Debt**: 28 critical issues beyond the circular patterns
- **Database-Driven**: 154+ components across 8 room types
- **LOC**: 51,531 lines of TypeScript
- **Test Coverage**: 0.006% (3 test files)

**Critical Problem**: The codebase has grown organically without initial architectural planning, leading to positioning logic inconsistencies and circular dependency patterns that cause AI agents (and developers) to go in circles when attempting fixes.

### 1.4 Enhancement Scope Definition

**Enhancement Type**: ✅ **Technical Debt Remediation & Architectural Stabilization**

**Enhancement Description**:

Systematically eliminate 5 circular dependency patterns and 28 critical issues that cause AI coding agents to loop endlessly when attempting fixes. Establish architectural guardrails, comprehensive documentation, and stable foundations to enable efficient bug fixing and future feature development without confusion or circular patterns.

**Impact Assessment**: ✅ **Major Impact (architectural changes required)**

This remediation will touch:
- Core positioning logic (PositionCalculation.ts, DesignCanvas2D.tsx, EnhancedModels3D.tsx)
- State management (ProjectContext.tsx)
- Database schema (type regeneration)
- Component library (154 components need Z-position audit)
- Testing infrastructure (0.006% → 70% coverage goal)

---

### 1.5 Goals and Background Context

**Goals**:
- Eliminate all 5 circular dependency patterns that trap AI agents in infinite loops
- Fix 28 critical issues identified in comprehensive code review
- Establish 70% test coverage for circular pattern areas
- Create unified coordinate transformation system
- Document architectural guardrails for AI agents
- Enable efficient bug fixing without circular confusion
- Prepare stable foundation for feature assessment phase

**Background Context**:

RightFit Interior Designer started as a simple lead generator for a kitchen fitting business and evolved into a full multi-room interior design platform. The application grew organically without initial architectural planning, adding features incrementally based on user needs.

This organic growth led to three incompatible coordinate systems (plan view, elevation views, 3D view) with no unified transformation layer. When AI agents attempt to fix positioning issues in one view, they inadvertently break another view, creating infinite loops. Five distinct circular patterns have been identified, and 28 additional critical issues compound the problem.

The current state prevents efficient development: both AI agents and human developers spend excessive time navigating confusion rather than delivering value. This remediation establishes the stable foundation needed for the final 10% feature completion and payment integration work.

## 2. Requirements

### 2.1 Functional Requirements

**FR1**: The system shall eliminate Circular Pattern #1 (Positioning Coordinate Circle) by implementing a unified CoordinateTransformEngine that provides consistent coordinate transformations across plan view, all 4 elevation views, and 3D view.

**FR2**: The system shall eliminate Circular Pattern #2 (State Update Circle) by implementing deep equality checking for `design_elements` array changes to prevent false positive `hasUnsavedChanges` flags.

**FR3**: The system shall eliminate Circular Pattern #3 (Type/Schema Mismatch Circle) by regenerating TypeScript types from the Supabase schema and establishing a CI/CD process to keep types synchronized with database migrations.

**FR4**: The system shall eliminate Circular Pattern #4 (Corner Cabinet Logic Circle) by implementing a single-source-of-truth CornerCabinetDoorMatrix that determines door orientation based on corner position rather than view-specific rules.

**FR5**: The system shall eliminate Circular Pattern #5 (Height Property Circle) by establishing clear separation between `height` (component dimension) and `z` (position off floor), auditing all 154 components for explicit Z positions, and removing type-based height defaults.

**FR6**: The system shall implement comprehensive test coverage (70% minimum) for all circular pattern areas to enable safe refactoring and prevent regression.

**FR7**: The system shall remove 579 production console.log statements and implement environment-aware logging with structured logging service integration.

**FR8**: The system shall implement input validation layer using Zod schemas for all user inputs before database operations.

**FR9**: The system shall refactor DesignCanvas2D.tsx (currently 2,958 lines) into modular components (PlanViewCanvas, ElevationViewCanvas) with each component under 1,000 lines.

**FR10**: The system shall establish architectural guardrails documentation that prevents AI agents from entering circular loop patterns when making future changes.

### 2.2 Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR1**: All circular pattern fixes must maintain existing user-facing functionality - no visible changes to component positioning, rendering, or behavior.

**NFR2**: Performance shall not degrade - coordinate transformation optimizations must maintain or improve current rendering performance (target: 60 FPS in 2D canvas, 30 FPS in 3D view).

**NFR3**: Code maintainability shall improve measurably - cyclomatic complexity of circular pattern files shall decrease by minimum 40%.

**NFR4**: Type safety shall be enforced - zero `any` types allowed in circular pattern fix areas, all using strict TypeScript interfaces.

**NFR5**: Test execution time shall remain under 5 minutes for full test suite to enable rapid development feedback loops.

**NFR6**: Memory usage shall not increase by more than 10% after implementing CoordinateTransformEngine and test infrastructure.

**NFR7**: All database migrations must be reversible with documented rollback procedures.

**NFR8**: Code changes must be documented inline (JSDoc) with rationale for architectural decisions to guide future AI agents and developers.

### 2.3 Compatibility Requirements

**CR1: API Compatibility** - All Supabase RLS policies and database query patterns must remain unchanged to preserve existing authentication and data access logic.

**CR2: Database Schema Compatibility** - New database fields (e.g., `default_z_position`) must be nullable and backward-compatible with existing data; no breaking schema changes allowed.

**CR3: UI/UX Consistency** - Component rendering in all views (plan, elevation, 3D) must produce identical visual results after fixes as before fixes; user workflows must remain unchanged.

**CR4: Integration Compatibility** - Existing component library (154 components), room templates, and 3D model references must work without modification after coordinate system unification.

**CR5: Build Process Compatibility** - All fixes must work with existing Vite build configuration and npm scripts; no new build dependencies that would break current deployment pipeline.

## 3. Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

### 3.1 Existing Technology Stack

**Languages**: TypeScript 5.x (strict mode enabled)

**Frameworks**:
- React 18.2.0 (functional components, hooks pattern)
- Vite 4.x (build tool with fast HMR)

**Database**:
- Supabase Cloud (PostgreSQL 15.x)
- JSONB columns for `design_elements` and `design_settings`
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies for all user data

**Rendering**:
- Canvas API (2D rendering - direct canvas manipulation)
- Three.js r150+ via @react-three/fiber
- @react-three/drei (controls, loaders, helpers)

**UI Library**: shadcn/ui (Radix UI + Tailwind CSS 3.x)

**State Management**: React Context API with useReducer (no Redux/MobX)

**External Dependencies**:
- Lucide React (icons)
- React Router 6.x (client-side routing)
- React Hook Form 7.x + Zod 3.x (forms and validation)

### 3.2 Integration Approach

**Database Integration Strategy**:
- All schema changes via versioned migrations in `supabase/migrations/`
- Type regeneration required after every migration: `npx supabase gen types typescript`
- Maintain JSONB flexibility for `design_elements` while adding typed columns for critical fields
- Z-position audit delivered via migration with nullable `default_z_position` column

**API Integration Strategy**:
- Continue Supabase client auto-generated queries (no REST endpoints)
- Maintain existing RLS policies without modification
- New services (CoordinateTransformEngine, CornerCabinetDoorMatrix) are client-side utilities, not API changes
- Error handling via try-catch with toast notifications pattern

**Frontend Integration Strategy**:
- CoordinateTransformEngine replaces inline coordinate calculations
- PositionCalculation.ts, DesignCanvas2D.tsx, EnhancedModels3D.tsx refactored to use engine
- Legacy code removed after new system proven stable
- React.memo, useMemo, useCallback for performance optimization

**Testing Integration Strategy**:
- Playwright for E2E tests (already installed, needs configuration)
- Jest/Vitest for unit tests (to be added)
- Test files co-located with source: `ComponentName.test.ts`
- CI/CD integration via GitHub Actions (to be configured)

### 3.3 Code Organization and Standards

**File Structure Approach**:
- Maintain existing structure: `src/components/`, `src/services/`, `src/utils/`
- New utilities: `src/utils/CoordinateTransformEngine.ts`, `src/utils/CornerCabinetDoorMatrix.ts`, `src/utils/ComponentPositionValidator.ts`
- Test files co-located: `src/utils/__tests__/CoordinateTransformEngine.test.ts`
- Migration files: `supabase/migrations/YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_description.sql`

**Naming Conventions**:
- TypeScript: camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for components/classes
- Database: snake_case for tables and columns
- Files: PascalCase for components (`DesignCanvas2D.tsx`), camelCase for utils (`positionCalculation.ts`)
- Test files: `ComponentName.test.ts` or `utilityName.test.ts`

**Coding Standards**:
- Strict TypeScript mode enabled - no `any` types without explicit justification
- All public methods require JSDoc comments with rationale
- Prefer interfaces over types for object shapes
- Use type guards for runtime validation
- Memoize context functions with `useCallback` to prevent infinite loops

**Documentation Standards**:
- Inline JSDoc for all public APIs
- README.md files for complex modules
- Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) for major changes
- Update CLAUDE.md with new patterns discovered during fixes

### 3.4 Deployment and Operations

**Build Process Integration**:
- Existing Vite configuration maintained
- Type checking via `npm run type-check` (required before commits)
- Linting via `npm run lint`
- New scripts: `npm test`, `npm run test:e2e`

**Deployment Strategy**:
- Current: Manual deployment (no CI/CD)
- Target: GitHub Actions for type checking and tests on PR
- Database migrations: Manual `npx supabase db push` (no automated migration deployment yet)
- Static hosting (Vercel/Netlify) with environment variables

**Monitoring and Logging**:
- Current: Browser console only (579 console statements to be removed)
- Target: Structured logging via environment-aware Logger utility
- Production: Error tracking service (Sentry recommended, not yet integrated)
- Performance Monitor (god mode) available for debugging

**Configuration Management**:
- `.env.local` for local development (not tracked in git)
- Environment variables: `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID`
- Feature flags: `use_new_positioning_system` (default: true, to be removed after legacy code cleanup)

### 3.5 Risk Assessment and Mitigation

**Technical Risks**:

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|-------------|--------|---------------------|
| Coordinate system changes break existing projects | Medium | High | Implement round-trip validation tests; maintain backward compatibility; add migration script for existing data |
| Test coverage goal (70%) too aggressive | Medium | Medium | Prioritize circular pattern areas first; defer full coverage to Phase 2 |
| DesignCanvas2D refactor introduces regressions | High | High | Incremental refactoring; maintain legacy code path during transition; visual regression tests |
| Type regeneration breaks existing code | Low | Medium | Run full test suite after type regeneration; fix TypeScript errors before proceeding |

**Integration Risks**:

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|-------------|--------|---------------------|
| CoordinateTransformEngine performance overhead | Low | Medium | Performance benchmarks before/after; optimize hot paths; use memoization |
| Database migration fails in production | Low | High | Test all migrations in development; document rollback procedures; use transactions |
| Component Z-position audit reveals data corruption | Medium | Medium | Audit script validates before updating; manual review of edge cases; staged rollout |

**Deployment Risks**:

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|-------------|--------|---------------------|
| Breaking change deployed to production | Low | Critical | Maintain compatibility requirements (CR1-CR5); staged deployment; rollback plan |
| New dependencies break build | Low | Medium | Lock dependency versions; test build in clean environment before deployment |

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- **Phased Rollout**: Fix circular patterns in sequence (P1 → P2) with validation between phases
- **Automated Testing**: 70% coverage provides safety net for refactoring
- **Documentation**: Inline rationale helps future maintainers understand decisions
- **Backward Compatibility**: CR1-CR5 requirements ensure no breaking changes
- **Rollback Plans**: All migrations reversible; feature flags for progressive enhancement

## 4. Epic and Story Structure

### 4.1 Epic Approach

**Epic Structure Decision**: **Single comprehensive epic** for eliminating all 5 circular dependency patterns.

**Rationale**:
- The 5 circular patterns are interdependent (Fix #1 is prerequisite for Fix #5)
- Winston's analysis shows clear dependency graph requiring sequential execution
- Splitting into multiple epics would create artificial boundaries
- Total work (30.5 hours) is manageable within a single epic
- All stories contribute to single goal: "Stable foundation for bug fixing"

**Epic Goal**: Eliminate all circular dependency patterns, establish 70% test coverage for critical areas, and document architectural guardrails to enable efficient bug fixing and feature development without AI agent confusion or infinite loops.

---

## Epic 1: Eliminate Circular Dependency Patterns and Establish Stable Foundation

**Epic Goal**: Systematically eliminate all 5 circular dependency patterns identified by Winston's architectural analysis, implement comprehensive test coverage for circular pattern areas, and establish architectural guardrails that prevent AI agents from entering infinite loops when making future changes.

**Integration Requirements**:
- Maintain 100% backward compatibility with existing user data and workflows
- All coordinate transformations must produce identical visual results as current system
- Zero breaking changes to Supabase schema, RLS policies, or API patterns
- Performance must maintain or improve current benchmarks (60 FPS 2D, 30 FPS 3D)

**Success Criteria**:
- All 5 circular patterns eliminated with passing tests
- 70% test coverage achieved for circular pattern code areas
- AI agents can fix positioning bugs without entering infinite loops
- Coordinate system transformations validated with <0.1cm round-trip error
- Legacy asymmetric code removed and replaced with unified transformations
- Documentation updated with architectural guardrails

**Total Estimated Effort**: 30.5 hours (P1 fixes) + 88-128 hours (test coverage) = ~120-160 hours

### Story 1.13: Remove Production Console Logs and Implement Structured Logging

**User Story**:
As a developer,
I want environment-aware logging that doesn't expose internal logic in production,
so that the application is secure and performant.

**Priority**: P2

**Estimated Effort**: 4 hours

**Dependencies**: None

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. `Logger` utility class created with environment checks
2. All 579 console.log/warn/error statements replaced with `Logger.*` calls
3. Vite plugin configured to strip Logger calls in production builds
4. Integration with error tracking service prepared (Sentry recommended)
5. Development mode: All logs visible with color coding
6. Production mode: Only errors logged, sent to error tracking service

**Integration Verification**:
- IV1: Development build shows all expected logs
- IV2: Production build has zero console statements (verified in bundle)
- IV3: Error tracking service receives production errors (if configured)

**Implementation Reference**: [CODE_REVIEW_COMPREHENSIVE.md](./CODE_REVIEW_COMPREHENSIVE.md) - Issue #1, Critical Priority

### Story 1.14: Implement Input Validation Layer

**User Story**:
As a user,
I want my inputs validated before reaching the database,
so that I get helpful error messages instead of cryptic database errors.

**Priority**: P2

**Estimated Effort**: 8 hours

**Dependencies**: Story 1.1 (types must be current)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Zod schemas created for all user input types:
   - `ProjectSchema` - Project name, metadata
   - `RoomDimensionsSchema` - Width (100-2000cm), depth (100-2000cm), height (200-400cm)
   - `DesignElementSchema` - Position bounds, dimension minimums
2. Validation middleware applied to all user inputs before Supabase calls
3. Client-side validation provides immediate feedback
4. Server-side validation (RLS policies) remains as backup
5. User-friendly error messages for validation failures

**Integration Verification**:
- IV1: Valid inputs pass through unchanged
- IV2: Invalid room dimensions (e.g., 1cm × 1cm) rejected with helpful message
- IV3: SQL injection attempts blocked (verified with security testing)
