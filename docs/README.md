## How to Use This Documentation

### For AI Coding Agents

**If you're starting a new work session:**

1. **Read [prd.md](./prd.md)** first to understand the overall plan
2. **Identify your story** from Epic 1 (Stories 1.1-1.17)
3. **Review the implementation reference** linked in your story
4. **Follow the acceptance criteria** and integration verification steps
5. **Consult [coordinate-system-visual-guide.md](./coordinate-system-visual-guide.md)** for positioning work

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL RULES:**

- **Never modify multiple views in isolation** - Always test plan + 4 elevations + 3D
- **Always use CoordinateTransformEngine** after Story 1.2 is complete
- **Always run integration verification** steps from your story
- **Never skip compatibility requirements** (CR1-CR5)
- **Document your rationale** in JSDoc comments

### For Human Developers

1. Start with [prd.md](./prd.md) for the big picture
2. Review Winston's [brownfield-architecture.md](./brownfield-architecture.md) for deep understanding
3. Check James's [CODE_REVIEW_COMPREHENSIVE.md](./CODE_REVIEW_COMPREHENSIVE.md) for known issues
4. Follow the story sequence from [prd.md](./prd.md)

### For Project Managers

- **Current Plan**: [prd.md](./prd.md) - 17 stories, ~120 hours estimated
- **Progress Tracking**: Check story completion status in [prd.md](./prd.md) Section 4
- **Success Metrics**: [prd.md](./prd.md) Section 5
- **Next Steps**: [prd.md](./prd.md) Section 6 (Phase 2: Bug Fixing, Phase 3: Feature Assessment)

## Work Organization

### Current Workflow: Epic/Story Structure

Starting 2025-10-26, all work follows an **Epic/Story structure** as defined in [prd.md](./prd.md).

**Story Cards Available:**
- **[stories/](./stories/)** - Individual story task cards with checklists
- **[stories/README.md](./stories/README.md)** - Story status overview and dependency graph

**Session Folder Naming Convention:**
```
session-2025-10-26-story-1.1-typescript-types/
session-2025-10-27-story-1.2-coordinate-engine/
session-2025-10-28-story-1.3-position-calculation/
```

Each session folder should reference its story number for traceability.

## Historical Documentation

**üì¶ [archive/](./archive/)** - Previous exploratory work (FOR REFERENCE ONLY)

‚ö†Ô∏è **These documents may contain outdated approaches and should NOT be used as authoritative sources.**

Historical session folders (`session-2025-*`) have been archived to prevent confusion. They represent exploratory work that led to the current plan but may have:
- Circular dependency patterns that were later identified as problematic
- Incomplete fixes that were superseded
- Different architectural approaches than the current plan

**When to reference archived sessions:**
- Understanding the history of a specific feature
- Researching why certain approaches were abandoned
- Learning from past mistakes

**When NOT to reference archived sessions:**
- Planning new work (use [prd.md](./prd.md) instead)
- Understanding current architecture (use [brownfield-architecture.md](./brownfield-architecture.md))
- Fixing bugs (use [circular-patterns-fix-plan.md](./circular-patterns-fix-plan.md))
