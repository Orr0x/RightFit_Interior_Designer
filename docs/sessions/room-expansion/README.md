# Room Expansion Session

**Branch:** `feature/room-expansion`
**Started:** 2025-10-10
**Base Branch:** `feature/feature-flag-system`

## Session Goal

Expand the application to support multiple room types beyond kitchen, implementing the full multi-room design system.

## Current Status

**Starting Point:**
- ✅ Kitchen room fully functional
- ✅ Database integration working
- ✅ Component system with 194 components
- ✅ Infinite loop bug fixed
- ✅ Console logger implemented

**What We Have:**
- Kitchen: 94 components available
- Database tables: `components`, `component_types`, `room_templates`
- Room type support: 12 room types defined in database

## Room Types to Expand

Based on database schema, we need to implement:

1. **Bedroom** (bedroom, master-bedroom, guest-bedroom)
2. **Bathroom** (bathroom, ensuite)
3. **Living Room** (living-room)
4. **Dining Room** (dining-room)
5. **Office** (office)
6. **Dressing Room** (dressing-room)
7. **Utility Room** (utility)
8. **Under Stairs** (under-stairs)

## Components Available

From `components` table analysis:
- Total components: 194
- Kitchen: 94 components
- Bedroom: ~30 components
- Bathroom: ~20 components
- Living room: ~15 components
- Office: ~10 components
- Universal: ~25 components

## Work Plan

### Phase 1: Component Analysis
- [ ] Query components by room type
- [ ] Verify component categories for each room
- [ ] Check 3D models availability
- [ ] Document component gaps

### Phase 2: UI Updates
- [ ] Update room type selector
- [ ] Add room-specific component categories
- [ ] Update component sidebar for different rooms
- [ ] Implement room-specific defaults

### Phase 3: Database Integration
- [ ] Verify room templates exist
- [ ] Add missing room templates if needed
- [ ] Test room switching
- [ ] Verify component loading per room

### Phase 4: 3D Rendering
- [ ] Test 3D models for non-kitchen components
- [ ] Verify positioning for different room types
- [ ] Check wall snapping for all room types
- [ ] Test room color schemes

### Phase 5: Testing
- [ ] Test each room type individually
- [ ] Test room switching within projects
- [ ] Test component placement in each room
- [ ] Performance testing with multiple rooms
