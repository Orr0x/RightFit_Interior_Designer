## ✅ Completed Work

### Phase 1: Database Migration ✅ COMPLETE
**Status:** Successfully executed in Supabase

**Files Created:**
1. `ADD_COLLISION_DETECTION_LAYER_FIELDS.sql` - Initial database migration
2. `POPULATE_REMAINING_COMPONENTS.sql` - Supplementary component population

**Database Changes:**
- Added 4 columns to `component_3d_models` table:
  - `layer_type` VARCHAR(50) - Component layer classification
  - `min_height_cm` DECIMAL(10,2) - Minimum height from floor
  - `max_height_cm` DECIMAL(10,2) - Maximum height from floor
  - `can_overlap_layers` TEXT[] - Array of overlappable layer types
- Created index on `layer_type` for performance
- Populated all 176 components across 12 layer types

**Layer Distribution:**
| Layer Type | Count | Component Types | Height Range |
|------------|-------|-----------------|--------------|
| base | 19 | base-cabinet, cabinet, drawer-unit | 0-90cm |
| wall | 8 | wall-cabinet | 140-220cm |
| tall | 10 | tall-unit, wardrobe | 0-220cm |
| worktop | 7 | counter-top | 90-92cm |
| pelmet | 4 | pelmet | 135-140cm |
| cornice | 4 | cornice | 220-240cm |
| appliance | 16 | appliance, washing-machine | 0-90cm |
| sink | 22 | sink | 85-92cm |
| furniture | 59 | bed, desk, sofa, table, etc. | varies |
| fixture | 5 | bathtub, shower | varies |
| architectural | 19 | door, window | varies |
| finishing | 3 | end-panel | 0-240cm |

### Phase 2: TypeScript Hooks ✅ COMPLETE
**Status:** Implemented and committed

**New Files Created:**

#### 1. `src/hooks/useComponentMetadata.ts`
**Purpose:** Fetch component layer metadata from `component_3d_models` table

**Functions:**
- `getComponentMetadata(componentId)` - Get metadata for specific component
- `getComponentsByLayerType(layerType)` - Get all components of a layer type
- `canComponentsOverlap(id1, id2)` - Check if two components can overlap

**Features:**
- Fetches layer_type, min_height_cm, max_height_cm, can_overlap_layers
- Memoized lookups for performance
- Permissive fallback if metadata missing
- Console logging for debugging

#### 2. `src/hooks/useCollisionDetection.ts`
**Purpose:** Layer-aware collision detection with type-aware magnetic snapping

**Key Configuration:**
- `SNAP_THRESHOLD_CM = 10` - Magnetic snap only within 10cm (small enough for 30cm cabinets)
- `MAX_SEARCH_RADIUS_CM = 100` - Maximum distance to search for valid position

**Main Function:**
```typescript
validatePlacement(
  element: DesignElement,
  existingElements: DesignElement[],
  originalPosition?: { x: number; y: number }
): CollisionResult
```

**Collision Detection Logic:**
1. Check 2D (X/Y) overlap
2. Check 3D (height) overlap
3. Apply layer-based overlap rules
4. Suggest nearest valid position if invalid

**Magnetic Snapping Rules:**
- **Wall units** → snap to **wall units** (align edges)
- **Base units** → snap to **base units** (align edges)
- **Tall units** → snap to **both base AND wall units** (align with either)
- **Other components** → no magnetic snapping (collision avoidance only)

**Snapping Behavior:**
- Only snaps if within **10cm** of snap point
- Tries 4 edge positions per target component (left, right, top, bottom)
- Uses closest valid snap point
- Falls back to collision-free position search if no snap point within 10cm

**Features:**
- Drop-time validation only (no real-time checking during drag)
- Intelligent position suggestion algorithm
- Expanding radius search (10cm, 20cm, ... 100cm)
- 8-direction search per radius
- Returns to original position if no valid position found

## ⏳ Next Steps (Pending)

### Phase 3: Integrate into DesignCanvas2D.tsx
**Status:** Not started

**Required Changes:**
1. Import `useCollisionDetection` hook
2. Update `handleMouseDown` to store original position
3. Ensure `handleMouseMove` skips collision checking (performance)
4. Update `handleMouseUp` to:
   - Call `validatePlacement()` on drop
   - Handle valid placement (update position)
   - Handle invalid placement with snap (use suggested position + toast)
   - Handle invalid placement without snap (return to original + toast)

**File to Modify:**
- `src/components/designer/DesignCanvas2D.tsx` (lines 2185-2270)

---

### Phase 4: Testing
**Status:** Not started

**Test Cases Defined:**

1. **Base Unit + Base Unit**
   - Expected: ❌ Collision detected, snap to edge or nearby position

2. **Wall Unit + Base Unit**
   - Expected: ✅ Valid placement (different heights)

3. **Worktop + Base Unit**
   - Expected: ✅ Valid placement (worktop sits on base)

4. **Tall Unit + Wall Unit**
   - Expected: ❌ Collision detected (tall blocks everything)

5. **Base Unit Magnetic Snapping**
   - Place base at x=0, drag second base to x=55
   - Expected: Snaps to x=60 (edge-to-edge alignment)

6. **Wall Unit Magnetic Snapping**
   - Place wall at y=0, drag second wall to y=75
   - Expected: Snaps to y=80 (edge-to-edge alignment)

7. **Tall Unit Snapping to Base**
   - Place base at x=0, drag tall to x=55
   - Expected: Snaps to x=60 (aligns with base)

8. **Tall Unit Snapping to Wall**
   - Place wall at x=0, drag tall to x=55
   - Expected: Snaps to x=60 (aligns with wall)

9. **No Snapping for Different Types**
   - Place base at x=0, drag wall to x=55
   - Expected: Placed at x=55 (no snapping, valid due to height difference)

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Drop-Time Validation (Not Real-Time)
**User Requirement:** "collision detection should only trigger on release/drop of the component"

**Rationale:**
- Better performance (no continuous checking during drag)
- Simpler visual feedback (no distracting red/green during drag)
- Clear outcome on drop
- Less cognitive load on user

### 2. Snap into Correct Position (User Error Handling)
**User Requirement:** "snap into correct position, to allow for user error"

**Implementation:**
- Primary behavior: Snap to nearest valid position (within 100cm)
- Fallback: Return to original position (only if no valid position found)
- Forgiving UX - helps user place components correctly

### 3. Type-Aware Magnetic Snapping
**User Requirement:** "wall units snap to wall units, base units snap to base units, tall units snap to both base and wall units"

**Implementation:**
- Intelligent snap target selection based on layer_type
- Edge-to-edge alignment (4 positions per target)
- Priority given to same-type snapping over collision-free search

### 4. Snap Threshold: 10cm (Not Too Sticky)
**User Feedback:** "magnet not too sticky or ill turn it off its anoying as it drags off the mouse pointer" + "20cm might be a bit mutch some cabinets are only 30cm wide"

**Implementation:**
- Reduced from 20cm to 10cm
- Only snaps if within 10cm of valid snap point
- Small enough for 30cm cabinets (1/3 of width)
- Beyond 10cm, no magnetic snapping (prevents annoying drag-away behavior)
- Can be disabled by setting `SNAP_THRESHOLD_CM = 0`

├── Fetches layer data from database
├── Provides getComponentMetadata(id)
└── Memoized for performance

useCollisionDetection
├── Validates placement (2D + 3D + layer rules)
├── Finds snap targets (type-aware)
├── Finds nearest valid position (magnetic + collision-free search)
└── Returns CollisionResult with suggested position
```

### UI Integration Layer (Pending)
```
DesignCanvas2D.tsx
└── handleMouseUp (drop event)
    ├── Call validatePlacement()
    ├── If valid → update position
    ├── If invalid + suggested → snap to suggested + toast

```
