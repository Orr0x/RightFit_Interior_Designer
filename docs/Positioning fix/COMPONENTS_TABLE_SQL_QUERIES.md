UNION ALL

SELECT 
    'Deprecated Components',
    COUNT(*)::text

UNION ALL

SELECT 
    'Unique Categories',
    COUNT(DISTINCT category)::text
FROM components
WHERE deprecated = false

UNION ALL

SELECT 
    'Unique Types',
    COUNT(DISTINCT type)::text
FROM components
WHERE deprecated = false

UNION ALL

SELECT 
    'Corner Components',
    COUNT(*)::text
FROM components
WHERE deprecated = false
  AND corner_configuration IS NOT NULL
  AND (corner_configuration->>'is_corner')::boolean = true

UNION ALL

SELECT 
    'Components with Custom Behavior',
    COUNT(*)::text
FROM components
WHERE deprecated = false
  AND component_behavior IS NOT NULL;
```

## üîß **Usage Instructions**

### **For Data Analysis**
- Use queries 1-9 for comprehensive data analysis
- Use query 10 for data quality assessment
- Use query 13 for quick statistics

### **For Data Export**
- Use query 11 for CSV export (adjust file path as needed)
- Use query 12 for sample data testing

### **For Application Integration**
- Use query 6 for active components only
- Use query 1 for complete data with all fields

## üìä **Expected Results**

Based on the analysis, you should expect:
- **168 total components**
- **168 active components** (0 deprecated)
- **~8-10 categories** (base-units, wall-units, etc.)
- **~5-7 types** (cabinet, appliance, etc.)
- **~90% kitchen components**
- **~10-15 corner components**
- **~20-30 components with custom behavior**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Data Quality Notes**

- **component_id**: Uses string format (e.g., "l-shaped-test-cabinet") instead of UUID
- **door_side**: Uses string format (e.g., "front") instead of UUID
- **All other fields**: Properly formatted and validated
- **No deprecated components**: All 168 components are active
