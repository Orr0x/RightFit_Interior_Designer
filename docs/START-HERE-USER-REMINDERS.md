# 🚨 START HERE - Critical User Reminders & Context

**Date Created:** 2025-10-12
**Current Branch:** `feature/coordinate-system-setup`
**Priority:** READ THIS FIRST before any new chat session

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: What We're Working On NOW

### Current Task: Coordinate System Setup & Verification

**Branch:** `feature/coordinate-system-setup`
**Status:** Just started
**Goal:** Verify and fix component positioning and coordinate system before finalizing elevation views

**User Quote:**
> "I want to do some work on coordinats and positioning next so when you have documented the work so far create a new branch for coordinate system setup. I think we need to make sure this is done before we caqn confirm or finish the elevation view work as we need to ensure the componwents are where they are supposed to be."

### Why This Matters
- Element visibility in elevation views depends on accurate wall detection
- Wall detection depends on correct coordinate system
- Cannot finalize elevation view duplication work until coordinates are verified
- Testing has been postponed until coordinates are fixed

---

## 🎯 Current Strategy: Elevation Views for Complex Rooms

### ✅ APPROVED APPROACH (User's Explicit Choice)

**Strategy:** Elevation View Duplication + Manual Element Hiding

**How It Works:**
1. Keep existing cardinal direction filtering (NESW) - IT'S GOOD AS IS
2. Add ability to duplicate elevation views (max 3 per direction)
3. Users manually hide/show elements in each duplicated view
4. Two-stage filtering: direction filtering + per-view hidden elements

**Example Use Case (L-Shaped Kitchen):**
- Duplicate "Front" view → creates "Front (1)"
- In "Front" view: hide interior wall cabinets
- In "Front (1)" view: hide perimeter cabinets
- Result: Two front views showing different wall segments

**Key User Requirements:**
1. "current logic does pick what is visible in each elevation nesw, this is good as is"
2. "i dont want to al of a sudden have all components on all elevations"
3. Must be database-first, no hardcoding
4. Max 3 views per direction (handles H-shaped rooms with 3 walls per direction)

**Storage:**
- Stored in `design_settings.elevation_views` (JSONB)
- No schema migration needed
- Backward compatible (defaults to 4 cardinal views)

### ❌ REJECTED APPROACHES (DO NOT IMPLEMENT)

1. **Wall-Count Elevation System** (abandoned in `feature/wall-count-elevation-views`)
   - Attempted algorithmic wall-to-element matching
   - Used perpendicular distance calculations with 20cm tolerance
   - Failed to handle islands, peninsulas, ambiguous placements
   - TOO COMPLEX, user rejected this approach

2. **Automatic Wall Segment Detection**
   - Any approach that tries to automatically determine which wall segment an element belongs to
   - User wants MANUAL curation, not algorithmic determination

3. **All Elements on All Elevations**
   - User explicitly does NOT want this
   - Must preserve existing cardinal direction filtering

### 📁 Implementation Status

**Completed (feature/elevation-simplified branch):**
- ✅ TypeScript interfaces (ElevationViewConfig)
- ✅ Helper functions (elevationViewHelpers.ts - 285 lines)
- ✅ ViewSelector UI with right-click context menu
- ✅ Designer.tsx state management
- ✅ DesignCanvas2D filtering logic
- ✅ Mobile layout support
- ✅ Bug fixes (wall dimension calculations)
- ✅ Documentation (670 lines)

**Blocked (awaiting coordinate fix):**
- ⏸️ Testing elevation view filtering
- ⏸️ Element visibility toggle UI
- ⏸️ User workflow validation
- ⏸️ Finalization and merge

## 🚫 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. Don't Re-implement Wall-Count System
**Wrong:** "Let me implement automatic wall segment detection using geometry calculations"
**Right:** "Let me focus on coordinate system verification as requested"

### 2. Don't Change Existing Cardinal Direction Filtering
**Wrong:** "Let me modify the existing NESW filtering to show all elements"
**Right:** "Keep existing direction filtering, only add per-view hidden elements on top"

### 3. Don't Skip Coordinate Verification
**Wrong:** "Let me finish the elevation view UI first"
**Right:** "Coordinate system must be verified first before finalizing elevation views"

### 4. Don't Hardcode Room Geometry
**Wrong:** "Let me add hardcoded logic for L-shaped rooms"
**Right:** "Follow database-first approach, use JSONB templates"

## 🎯 User's Explicit Requirements (Direct Quotes)

### On Elevation View Strategy:
> "i may have another easier approach... we also already have the ability to make components visible or not. currently in elevation view we see components on each elevation and ones that are on internal walls, so we can hide the ones we dont want to see. the problem is 90% fixed without doing anything to the code using already available settings. If we had the capability to duplicate an elevation view we could hide different components on the duplicated elevation giving us any additional views as needed"

### On Preserving Existing Behavior:
> "so current logic does pick what is visible in each elevation nesw, this is good as is, i dont want to al of a sudden have all components on all elevations, this will add complexity to the user."

### On Database-First Approach:
> "we have previoulsy spent a lot of time migrating all the component data to the database and removing the hradcoded elements. can we make sure our solution is database first and follows existing table structures"

### On Maximum Views:
> "i think we can limit the number of duplicates for each elevation a max of 2 duplicates which makes 3 total for each elevataion, this covers the un made H shaped room which has 3 east walls and 3 w walls 3 nort walls and 3 south wall. I think this will cover every eventuality"

### On Coordinate System Priority:
> "I want to do some work on coordinats and positioning next so when you have documented the work so far create a new branch for coordinate system setup. I think we need to make sure this is done before we caqn confirm or finish the elevation view work as we need to ensure the componwents are where they are supposed to be."

### On Testing:
> "I have let the testing of this go until now as i thought it pointless untill we have everything in the database and not spread between files with duplicate dcode."

## 🔧 Technical Context

### Coordinate System (Current Understanding)
- X-Y plane for floor (horizontal)
- Z-axis for height (vertical)
- Origin: TBD (needs verification)
- Units: Centimeters
- Need to verify: element positioning, wall detection, coordinate transforms

### Room Geometry System
- Stored in `design_settings.room_geometry` (JSONB)
- Templates in `room_geometry_templates` table
- Supports: Rectangle, L-shape, U-shape, custom polygons
- Phases 1-2 complete (database + types)
- Phase 3 in progress (3D rendering)

### Elevation View System
- Stored in `design_settings.elevation_views` (JSONB array)
- Default: 4 cardinal views (Front, Back, Left, Right)
- Custom: Up to 3 views per direction (12 total max)
- Filtering: Two-stage (direction + hidden elements)

### Element Wall Assignment
- Elements have `wall` property: 'front' | 'back' | 'left' | 'right' | 'center'
- Corner units have special visibility logic
- Center elements (islands) visible in all views by default
- Wall detection uses coordinate-based calculations (needs verification)

## 🎨 UI/UX Notes

### ViewSelector (Elevation Views)
- Vertical button list on left side of canvas
- Plan view button at top (Square icon)
- 4 elevation view buttons (Arrow icons: Up/Down/Left/Right)
- Right-click on any button → context menu
- Context menu options:
  - "Duplicate View" (if < 3 views for that direction)
  - "Rename View" (custom views only)
  - "Delete View" (custom views only)
- Inline rename dialog appears below button list
- Active view highlighted in blue

### DesignCanvas2D (Elevation Views)
- Shows wall dimensions based on direction
- Front/Back walls: room width (e.g., 600cm)
- Left/Right walls: room height (e.g., 400cm)
- Elements filtered by: direction + hidden_elements array
- Wall labels show direction (e.g., "Front Wall")

## 🎓 Learning from Past Decisions

### Why We Abandoned Wall-Count System
1. **Complexity:** Required complex geometry calculations
2. **Edge cases:** Failed for islands, peninsulas, ambiguous placements
3. **Maintenance:** Hard to debug and maintain
4. **User feedback:** User proposed simpler approach
5. **Better solution:** Manual curation is more flexible

### Why Manual Element Curation Won
1. **Simplicity:** Leverages existing visibility toggle
2. **Flexibility:** Handles ALL edge cases
3. **User control:** Designers know better than algorithms
4. **Maintainability:** Much easier to understand and debug
5. **Performance:** No complex calculations needed

### Why Coordinate Fix Comes First
1. **Foundation:** Everything depends on correct positioning
2. **Testing:** Can't validate elevation views without correct coords
3. **Confidence:** Need to trust positioning before building on it
4. **User priority:** Explicit requirement from user

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-12
**Current Session:** Coordinate System Setup
**Next Review:** After coordinate verification complete

**Remember:** When in doubt, ask the user! They have clear vision for this project.
