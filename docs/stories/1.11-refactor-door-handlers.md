# Story 1.11: Refactor Elevation View Handlers to Use Door Matrix

**Epic**: Epic 1 - Eliminate Circular Dependency Patterns
**Priority**: P2
**Effort**: 2 hours
**Status**: ✅ Complete

---

## User Story

As a developer,
I want elevation-view-handlers.ts to use CornerCabinetDoorMatrix,
so that view-specific door logic is eliminated.

---

## Dependencies

- ✅ Story 1.10 (door matrix must exist)

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] View-specific if/else chains deleted (lines 512-569)
- [x] `elevation-view-handlers.ts` imports and uses `CornerCabinetDoorMatrix.determineCornerDoorSide()`
- [x] Debug logging added (development mode only) for door side decisions
- [x] All 16 test scenarios pass (4 corners × 4 elevation views)

---

## Integration Verification

- [x] IV1: Front-left corner cabinet shows right door in all views
- [x] IV2: Front-right corner cabinet shows left door in all views
- [x] IV3: Manual override still works (user can force door side)
