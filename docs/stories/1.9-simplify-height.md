# Story 1.9: Simplify Height Property Usage in Rendering

**Epic**: Epic 1 - Eliminate Circular Dependency Patterns
**Priority**: P2
**Effort**: 3 hours
**Status**: ✅ Complete

---

## User Story

As a developer,
I want elevation and 3D views to use consistent height logic,
so that components appear at the same heights in all views.

---

## Dependencies

- ✅ Story 1.8 (component Z audit must be complete)

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `ComponentService.getZPosition()` method created - single source of truth for Z
- [x] `ComponentService.getElevationHeight()` simplified - always returns `element.height`
- [x] EnhancedModels3D uses `getZPosition()` for Y-axis calculation
- [x] DesignCanvas2D elevation view uses `getZPosition()` for vertical positioning
- [x] Hardcoded type-based height defaults removed (lines 1354-1435)

---

## Integration Verification

- [x] IV1: Wall cabinet at Z=140 appears at same height in elevation and 3D views
- [x] IV2: Base cabinet at Z=0 sits on floor in both elevation and 3D views
- [x] IV3: Existing projects render with no visual changes
