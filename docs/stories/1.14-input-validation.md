# Story 1.14: Implement Input Validation Layer

**Epic**: Epic 1 - Eliminate Circular Dependency Patterns
**Priority**: P2
**Effort**: 8 hours
**Status**: ðŸŸ¡ Not Started

---

## User Story

As a user,
I want my inputs validated before reaching the database,
so that I get helpful error messages instead of cryptic database errors.

---

## Dependencies

- âœ… Story 1.1 (types must be current)

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Zod schemas created for all user input types:
  - [ ] `ProjectSchema` - Project name, metadata
  - [ ] `RoomDimensionsSchema` - Width (100-2000cm), depth (100-2000cm), height (200-400cm)
  - [ ] `DesignElementSchema` - Position bounds, dimension minimums
- [ ] Validation middleware applied to all user inputs before Supabase calls
- [ ] Client-side validation provides immediate feedback
- [ ] Server-side validation (RLS policies) remains as backup
- [ ] User-friendly error messages for validation failures

---

## Integration Verification

- [ ] IV1: Valid inputs pass through unchanged
- [ ] IV2: Invalid room dimensions (e.g., 1cm Ã— 1cm) rejected with helpful message
- [ ] IV3: SQL injection attempts blocked (verified with security testing)
