# Story 1.17: Create Documentation Archive Structure

**Epic**: Epic 1 - Eliminate Circular Dependency Patterns
**Priority**: P2
**Effort**: 1 hour
**Status**: ✅ **Complete**

## User Story

As a developer or AI agent,
I want a clear separation between current authoritative docs and historical sessions,
so that I don't get confused by outdated approaches.

---

## Dependencies

- None

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `docs/README.md` created listing authoritative documentation
- [x] `docs/archive/` folder created

- [x] All `session-2025-*` folders moved to `docs/archive/`
- [x] README clearly states: "For current work, see prd.md and linked documents"

---
