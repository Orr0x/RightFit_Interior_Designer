**Epic**: Epic 1 - Eliminate Circular Dependency Patterns
**Priority**: P2
**Effort**: 4 hours
**Status**: ðŸŸ¡ Not Started

## User Story

As a developer,
I want environment-aware logging that doesn't expose internal logic in production,
so that the application is secure and performant.

---

## Dependencies

- None

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `Logger` utility class created with environment checks
- [ ] All 579 console.log/warn/error statements replaced with `Logger.*` calls
- [ ] Vite plugin configured to strip Logger calls in production builds
- [ ] Integration with error tracking service prepared (Sentry recommended)
- [ ] Development mode: All logs visible with color coding
- [ ] Production mode: Only errors logged, sent to error tracking service

---

## Integration Verification

- [ ] IV1: Development build shows all expected logs
- [ ] IV2: Production build has zero console statements (verified in bundle)
- [ ] IV3: Error tracking service receives production errors (if configured)

---
