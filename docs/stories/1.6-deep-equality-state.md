# Story 1.6: Implement Deep Equality Check for State Updates

**Epic**: Epic 1 - Eliminate Circular Dependency Patterns
**Priority**: P1
**Effort**: 2 hours (actual: 1 hour)
**Status**: ✅ Complete

---

## User Story

As a user,
I want the "unsaved changes" indicator to only show when I actually make changes,
so that I'm not confused by false positives after successful saves.

---

## Dependencies

- ✅ Story 1.1 (types must be current)

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `lodash.isequal` installed and configured
- [x] ProjectContext.tsx (lines 886-890) uses deep equality check instead of reference comparison
- [x] `prevElementsRef` and `prevDimensionsRef` track previous values
- [x] `hasUnsavedChanges` flag only set to true when actual data changes detected
- [x] Optimistic flag clearing in `saveCurrentDesign()` (clear before save, restore on error)
- [x] Debouncing implemented for auto-save (1 second debounce)

---

## Integration Verification

- [ ] IV1: Saving design clears `hasUnsavedChanges` flag and doesn't immediately re-set it
- [ ] IV2: Actual element changes still trigger `hasUnsavedChanges` flag correctly
- [ ] IV3: Save error restores `hasUnsavedChanges` flag to true
