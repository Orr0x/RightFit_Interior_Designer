# Story 1.12: Establish Test Infrastructure and Coverage

**Epic**: Epic 1 - Eliminate Circular Dependency Patterns
**Priority**: P1 (run in parallel with Stories 1.2-1.11)
**Effort**: 40 hours
**Status**: ðŸŸ¡ Not Started

---

## User Story

As a developer,
I want comprehensive test coverage for circular pattern areas,
so that I can refactor safely without introducing regressions.

---

## Dependencies

- âœ… Story 1.1 (types must be current)

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Playwright configured for E2E tests (`playwright.config.ts` created)
- [ ] Jest/Vitest configured for unit tests
- [ ] Test files created for all circular pattern utilities:
  - [ ] `CoordinateTransformEngine.test.ts` (comprehensive coverage)
  - [ ] `PositionCalculation.test.ts` (feature flag and transformation tests)
  - [ ] `ComponentPositionValidator.test.ts`
  - [ ] `CornerCabinetDoorMatrix.test.ts` (all 16 scenarios)
- [ ] E2E tests for critical workflows:
  - [ ] Place component in plan â†’ verify position in all views
  - [ ] Coordinate round-trip validation
  - [ ] Save/load preserves positions
- [ ] 70% code coverage achieved for circular pattern files
- [ ] Test suite runs in under 5 minutes

---

## Integration Verification

- [ ] IV1: All tests pass on current codebase before refactoring
- [ ] IV2: Tests catch intentional breaking changes (negative testing)
- [ ] IV3: CI/CD pipeline configured to run tests on PR (GitHub Actions)

---
