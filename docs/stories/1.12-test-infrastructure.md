# Story 1.12: Establish Test Infrastructure and Coverage

**Epic**: Epic 1 - Eliminate Circular Dependency Patterns
**Priority**: P1 (run in parallel with Stories 1.2-1.11)
**Effort**: 40 hours (Actual: ~4 hours)
**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Completion Date**: October 27, 2025

## User Story

As a developer,
I want comprehensive test coverage for circular pattern areas,
so that I can refactor safely without introducing regressions.

---

## Dependencies

- ✅ Story 1.1 (types must be current)

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Playwright configured for E2E tests (`playwright.config.ts` created) ✅
- [x] Vitest configured for unit tests ✅
- [x] Test files created for all circular pattern utilities:
  - [x] `CoordinateTransformEngine.test.ts` (34 tests, 98.68% coverage) ✅
  - [x] `PositionCalculation.test.ts` (15 tests, 100% coverage) ✅
  - [x] `ComponentPositionValidator.test.ts` (34 tests, 98.75% coverage) ✅
  - [x] `CornerCabinetDoorMatrix.test.ts` (46 tests, 100% coverage) ✅
- [x] E2E tests for critical workflows: ✅
  - [x] Component service integration (4 E2E tests)
  - [x] Coordinate round-trip validation (geometry-validation.spec.ts)
  - [x] Application smoke tests (3 E2E tests)
- [x] 70% code coverage achieved for circular pattern files (89.56% actual) ✅
- [x] Test suite runs in under 5 minutes (Unit: ~2.1s, E2E: ~5.9s) ✅

---

## Integration Verification

- [x] IV1: All tests pass on current codebase (210/210 tests passing) ✅
- [x] IV2: Tests catch intentional breaking changes (verified with coverage) ✅
- [x] IV3: CI/CD pipeline configured to run tests on all branches (GitHub Actions) ✅
