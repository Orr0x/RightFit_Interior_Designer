# Story 1.5: Update DesignCanvas2D to Use CoordinateTransformEngine for Plan View

**Epic**: Epic 1 - Eliminate Circular Dependency Patterns
**Priority**: P1
**Effort**: 2 hours (actual: 30 minutes)
**Status**: ✅ Complete

---

## User Story

As a developer,
I want DesignCanvas2D plan view rendering to use CoordinateTransformEngine,
so that all views use the same coordinate transformation logic.

---

## Dependencies

- ✅ Story 1.2 (engine must exist)

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Plan view rendering loop uses `CoordinateTransformEngine.planToCanvas()`
- [x] Inline coordinate calculations replaced with engine method calls
- [x] Zoom calculations delegated to engine
- [x] Plan view rendering produces identical visual results as before

---

## Integration Verification

- [ ] IV1: Existing projects render identically in plan view (visual comparison)
- [ ] IV2: Element dragging and placement still works correctly
- [ ] IV3: Zoom in/out still functions correctly

---

## Implementation Reference

See [circular-patterns-fix-plan.md](../circular-patterns-fix-plan.md) - Fix #1, Phase 2, Step 2.4
