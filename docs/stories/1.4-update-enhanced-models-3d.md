# Story 1.4: Update EnhancedModels3D to Use CoordinateTransformEngine

**Epic**: Epic 1 - Eliminate Circular Dependency Patterns
**Priority**: P1
**Effort**: 3 hours (actual)
**Status**: ✅ Complete

---

## User Story

As a developer,
I want EnhancedModels3D to use CoordinateTransformEngine for 3D positioning,
so that 2D and 3D views have consistent coordinate transformations.

---

## Dependencies

- ✅ Story 1.2 (engine must exist)

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `convertTo3D()` function replaced with `CoordinateTransformEngine.planTo3D()`
- [x] Manual coordinate calculations removed from component rendering loop
- [x] 3D component positions match plan view positions after transformation
- [x] Camera positioning still centers on room origin (0, 0, 0)

---

## Integration Verification

- [ ] IV1: Existing 3D scenes render identically (visual comparison) (deferred to Story 1.5)
- [ ] IV2: Component at plan position (100, 100) appears at correct 3D position (-1.0, 0.43, -2.2m) (deferred to Story 1.5)
- [ ] IV3: Walk mode still functions correctly (eye level 1.7m, WASD controls) (deferred to Story 1.5)

## Implementation Reference

See [circular-patterns-fix-plan.md](../circular-patterns-fix-plan.md) - Fix #1, Phase 2, Step 2.3
