# Story 1.1: Regenerate TypeScript Types and Fix Type/Schema Mismatch

**Epic**: Epic 1 - Eliminate Circular Dependency Patterns
**Priority**: P1 (PREREQUISITE for all other stories)
**Effort**: 30 minutes
**Status**: ✅ Complete

---

## User Story

As a developer,
I want TypeScript types to accurately reflect the current Supabase database schema,
so that I can access collision detection fields without TypeScript errors and prevent circular workarounds.

---

## Dependencies

- None (this is the first story)

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] TypeScript types regenerated via `npx supabase gen types typescript`
- [x] `component_3d_models` interface includes `layer_type`, `min_height_cm`, `max_height_cm`, `can_overlap_layers` fields
- [x] `npm run type-check` completes successfully with zero errors
- [x] Test query successfully accesses new fields without TypeScript compilation errors
- [x] Type generation process documented in development workflow

---

## Integration Verification

- [x] IV1: Existing code that doesn't use new fields compiles without changes
- [x] IV2: Database queries to `component_3d_models` table continue to work
- [x] IV3: No breaking changes to existing type definitions

---
