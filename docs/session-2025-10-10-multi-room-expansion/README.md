# Session: Multi-Room Type Implementation

**Date:** 2025-10-10
**Branch:** `feature/room-expansion`
**Session Focus:** Implement all 12 room types (kitchen, bedroom, bathroom, etc.) with full component libraries

**NOTE:** This is NOT about complex room shapes (L-shaped, U-shaped). That's future work documented in `session-2025-10-10-room-system-analysis/`. This session is about enabling the 12 room TYPES that already have templates in the database.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Component Analysis (Current)
- [ ] Query components by room_type from database
- [ ] Document component counts per room
- [ ] Verify component categories
- [ ] Check 3D model availability
- [ ] Identify gaps in component library

### Phase 2: UI Framework Updates
- [ ] Update room type selector UI
- [ ] Implement room-specific component filtering
- [ ] Update CompactComponentSidebar for all rooms
- [ ] Add room-specific component categories
- [ ] Create room type icons

### Phase 3: Database Verification
- [ ] Verify room_templates exist for all types
- [ ] Check component_types coverage
- [ ] Verify room default settings
- [ ] Test room creation for each type
- [ ] Validate room switching

### Phase 4: 3D Rendering Implementation
- [ ] Test 3D models for bedroom furniture
- [ ] Test 3D models for bathroom fixtures
- [ ] Test 3D models for living room furniture
- [ ] Test 3D models for office furniture
- [ ] Verify positioning and wall snapping for all rooms

### Phase 5: Room-Specific Features
- [ ] Implement bedroom-specific features (bed placement, wardrobe)
- [ ] Implement bathroom-specific features (fixtures, tiling)
- [ ] Implement living room-specific features (seating arrangements)
- [ ] Implement office-specific features (desk layouts)
- [ ] Add room-specific validation rules

### Phase 6: Comprehensive Testing
- [ ] Test each room type individually
- [ ] Test room switching within projects
- [ ] Test component placement in each room
- [ ] Performance testing with multiple rooms
- [ ] User workflow testing

## Technical Context

### Component Inventory (Estimated from Database)
- **Total:** 194 components
- **Kitchen:** 94 components (verified)
- **Bedroom:** ~30 components
- **Bathroom:** ~20 components
- **Living Room:** ~15 components
- **Office:** ~10 components
- **Universal:** ~25 components (doors, windows, finishing)

### Database Tables in Use
- `components` - Component definitions with room_type filtering
- `component_types` - Component metadata and defaults
- `room_templates` - Room type configuration
- `room_designs` - User-created room instances
- `projects` - Multi-room project containers

### Key Files to Modify
- `src/components/designer/CompactComponentSidebar.tsx` - Component filtering
- `src/types/project.ts` - RoomType enum
- `src/services/ComponentService.ts` - Component queries
- `src/services/RoomService.ts` - Room templates
- `src/components/3d/DynamicComponentRenderer.tsx` - 3D model loading

---

## Success Criteria

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
- [ ] All 12 room types selectable
- [ ] Components filter correctly by room type
- [ ] 3D rendering works for all component types
- [ ] Room switching maintains state correctly
- [ ] No performance degradation with multiple rooms

### Full Feature Set
- [ ] Room-specific component categories
- [ ] Room-specific default layouts
- [ ] Room-specific validation rules
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage
- [ ] Documentation updated

---

## Known Issues & Considerations

### Minor Issues (Non-Blocking)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è CompactComponentSidebar warning: "WALL UNITS CATEGORY MISSING"
  - Cosmetic naming mismatch (wall-units vs wall-cabinets)
  - Does not affect functionality
  - To be fixed separately

### Technical Considerations
- Component 3D models must exist for all room types
- Some universal components (doors, windows) work across all rooms
- Room dimensions may vary by type (bathrooms smaller, living rooms larger)
- Wall snapping behavior should be consistent across room types

## Resources

### Related Sessions
- `docs/session-2025-10-10-room-system-analysis/` - **Future work: Complex room shapes** (L-shaped, U-shaped)
  - Contains analysis for L-shape, U-shape, vaulted ceilings (3-4 month project)
  - NOT relevant to this session (we're doing simple rectangular rooms)
- `docs/session-2025-10-10-hardcoded-values-cleanup/` - Database migration work
- `docs/session-2025-10-09-2d-database-migration/` - 2D renderer updates

### Key Insight from Previous Session
The 12 room type templates ALREADY EXIST in database (`room_type_templates` table).
- We don't need to create them
- We just need to implement the UI and component filtering
- Complex room shapes (L-shaped, U-shaped) are FUTURE WORK (separate 3-4 month project)
